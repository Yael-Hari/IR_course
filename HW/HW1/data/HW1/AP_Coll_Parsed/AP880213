stage director yuri lyubimov who has been called 
the soviet unions greatest theatrical figure says he misses his 
homeland but welcomes the changes going on there since he was 
exiled four years ago 
i miss my theater my friends and my relatives but if i want 
snow i can always go to canada or chicago or call on solzhenitsyn 
in vermont he said in an interview at the royal opera house 
covent garden 
i also miss the unique soviet audiences who hunger for 
something spiritual said lyubimov among the worlds outstanding 
directors 
lyubimov a youthful 70 this year became a citizen of israel 
he lives in jerusalem with his hungarian wife katalin and son 
peter another son nikita is in moscow 
lyubimov talked to the associated press on wednesday night at 
the stage door after an applauded revival of his production of 
jenufa by czech composer leos janacek 
jenufa was first produced in 1904 and is a dark tale of 
peasant life murder and penance 
lyuibmov ran moscows defiant taganka theater and was on a 
london visit to direct a play in march 1984 when he became came 
under criticism from thenleader konstantin chernenko 
i was told i wouldnt be allowed to return home chernenko 
was half alive at the time and dead 12 months later the director 
recalled speaking through an interpreter 
lyubimov said hes hopeful that soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs policies of greater openness on selected subjects will 
last 
a lot of things once forbidden are now being seen in the 
soviet union films plays and books he said it would be a 
terrible tragedy if all this will be reversed like it was once 
before when nikita khrushchev was deposed 
but people coming from russia tell me they really believe the 
change is irreversible and i hope all people of good will in the 
west will help he said 
the director said his name in oblivion after his exile has 
been restored by public demand to the taganka theaters programs 
for revivals of his celebrated productions 
lyubimov said the soviet and israeli political climates are 
very different and im trying to reconcile them 
the royal opera disclosed it has lyubimov working on a new 
production of richard wagners demanding fouropera ring cycle 
for opening in september 
wagner a german composer of genius is anathema to many jews 
who regard him as an antisemite wagners music has been shouted 
down at concerts in israel 
wagner is also little performed in the soviet union 
lyubimov said i once wanted to to use the march from wagners 
twilight of the gods in a festival music program but it was 
forbidden 
the ring is performed in a variety of costumes these days 
from viking style to modern evening dress lyubimov when asked if 
his version will be traditional or modern replied im keeping 
that a secret but i will try to use different kinds of symbolism 
and psychological concepts to bring wagner closer to the people 
he said he was glad to be working on it with bernard haitink 
the royal operas recently appointed music director from holland 
wagners world is difficult to penetrate as he sought unity of 
all the forms music and drama and wrote a lot about it the hard 
part about producing wagner is that what you see on the stage must 
not destroy what you hear the director said

with a beretta pistol in 
her lap tzip haetzni pulled her car out of this hilltop community 
and joined a convoy of jewish settlers on patrol under the stars 
her husband eliakim an attorney sat beside her also armed 
after nine weeks of unrest in the occupied territories and two 
serious attacks on jewish settlers residents of kiryat arba 20 
miles south of jerusalem have begun nightly patrols 
we shall not be chased from this place haetzni 62 vowed 
as his wife steered the car past an arab refugee camp we shall 
meet the danger we will fight darkness by lighting up the night 
but these tactics while carried out by only a minority of the 
west banks 65000 jewish settlers have triggered panic and 
sometimes fueled new violence 
in the arab village of beit ummar this week a report of 
approaching settlers sounded from a mosque loudspeaker it was a 
false report but hundreds of palestinians fearing a vigilante 
attack rushed to the village outskirts armed with sticks and 
stones 
israeli soldiers who knew nothing of the false report tried to 
force the arabs back three villagers were killed in the clash the 
army said 
in other arab towns and refugee camps palestinians patrol their 
neighborhoods through the night looking for vigilantes 
the arab inciters have begun shouting the settlers are 
coming the settlers are coming to get everyone stirred up 
said mrs haetzni 60 
but the rumors are false she said we want to make our 
presence felt on the road we want the arabs to know we are here 
but most of us are happy to let the army do the fighting 
nevertheless kiryat arba residents say some of their men 
entered the nearby village o hebron one night and smashed windows 
of arabowned cars some settlers have also distributed leaflets in 
arab villages threatening retaliation against inciters of violence 
still the relationship between most israeli soldiers and 
settlers is better than ever 
with more than 100 troops stationed roundtheclock along the 
road from kiryat arba to jerusalem and a spotlight sweeping 
continuously over a nearby refugee camp many settlers feel the 
army is finally doing its job 
before it was like a toy army here so we had to protect 
ourselves haetzni said we never would have reached this stage 
if the army had been stronger earlier but at least they are acting 
now 
in an effort to help cement their new relationship the 
settlers threecar convoy took coffee cake and sunflower seeds to 
troops guarding the road overnight 
the convoy stopped outside the nearby village of beit ummar a 
closed military area where two dozen soldiers stood outside a 
palestinian home while arab children peered from the window above 
one soldier wore a checkered arab headdress wrapped around his 
face for warmth 
pvt rafi who would give only his first name in keeping with 
military regulations said the army has warmed to the presence of 
the settlers in the area 
we dont mind if they patrol the roads he said we and 
they are the same people even if we dont always see eyetoeye 
politically 
not all israelis agree some say the settlers are a source of 
provocation not protection defense minister yitzhak rabin has 
called them a heavy burden 
the appearance of armed settler patrols alongside israeli army 
forces creates the impression that the state of israel is 
encouraging jews in a war against the arabs the daily haaretz 
wrote this week 
the israeli army does not operate according to jewish tribal 
feelings and the farther it distances itself from the settlers 
the better 
but haetzni argues those israelis who dont understand our 
presence here also dont understand the arab mentality 
haetzni came to israel from germany at the age of 13 he built a 
lucrative law practice in tel aviv and then gave it up to move to 
kiryat arab 16 years ago 
he recalls being beaten up as a boy in germany because he was 
jewish and says it helped make me a better more realistic 
zionist today 
what israelis dont realize is the arabs do not want a state 
on this side of the green line he said referring to the 
pre1967 border of israel they want a state that extends all the 
way to the blue line the mediterranean sea

a drab lutheran church in east berlin has become 
the headquarters of a grassroots movement aimed at forcing reform 
upon the countrys aging and authoritarian communist leadership 
but unlike dissident movements of the past the lutheran 
movement has found itself looking more east than west for 
inspiration on how to change eastern europes most industrialized 
country 
we want to change the system from within we need to get some 
glasnost here a leading church member hans mayer said in 
reference to soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policy of openness 
and reform 
you can only get democracy when you fight for it said 
mayer who used an alias to protect himself from official reprisals 
while the zion church is the headquarters and focal point for 
the reform movement other lutheran churches in east berlin also 
have become rallying places for young adults seeking change 
dissidents were thrust into international attention after an 
official rally led by east german leader erich honecker on jan 17 
to honor german communist party founders rosa luxemburg and karl 
liebknecht 
members of the zion church tried to join the rally in a protest 
action against the nations leadership 
at least 100 dissidents were arrested and more than 60 of them 
have since been expelled to west germany the rest have also been 
released from east german jails 
the zion church which is located only about two blocks from the 
berlin wall turned into a magnet of dissent last year when its 
outspoken followers mostly between the ages of 20 to 35 began 
calling for more human rights and democracy in east germany 
there are no official estimates on the number of active 
dissidents gathering in east berlins 90 lutheran churches but 
informed sources put the number at several thousand 
another of the churches is the church of faith located near east 
germanys secret police headquarters 
although the movement has been gaining strength since at least 
1983 it was galvanized by two events in the soviet union 
gorbachevs rise to power in 1985 and the chernobyl nuclear fire in 
1986 
gorbachevs policies which call for some decentralization of 
economic and political life have been hailed by east german 
dissidents as the first good thing to come from the soviet union in 
decades 
while an international disaster the april 1986 chernobyl fire 
has also had its political uses alllowing those concerned with 
ecological issues to rally around an issue 
chernobyl was the biggest boost for the movement said karl 
wegner another church member who also used an alias to avoid 
police harassment 
people interested in ecological questions started to go to 
meetings in church basements because they soon found out the 
church reacted to their demand for a room he said 
incidents in east germany have further aided the movement 
on oct 17 a group of about 20 skinheads disenchanted 
rightist youths raided a rock concert in the zion church and beat 
up concertgoers with bicycle chains and clubs 
some sources say east german authorities fomented the attack 
while east germany claims provocateurs from west berlin were 
involved 
after the battle of zion things really got hot here said 
mayer speeking in the sleet near the 115yearold church 
but things could get hotter 
party leader honecker indicated friday that east germany wont 
copy reforms being implemented in the soviet union 
of course we follow developments in the soviet union and the 
other socialist countries very closely honecker said in a speech 
to party officials carried on the staterun news agency adn but 
that does not necessarily mean we intend to copy them 
such a lack of tolerance could mean more crackdowns 
mayer says millions of east germans watching west german 
televiion have followed the progress of the dissident movement 
thats led to an inundation of queries from people who simply want 
to leave and are looking for advice 
but mayer said his group does not want to become too involved 
with those people his concern is with those who have to stay 
at the zion church the movements resources are meager a 
10footby14foot room in a parish building and a basement 
ecology library 
about 1000 books line the shelves of the small windowless 
library next to joseph stalins thoughts on leninism is a copy 
of the officially banned west berlin newspaper tageszeitung 
east germany police raided the library in november confiscating 
duplicating machines and publications critical of government 
policies 
that raid resulted in 21 arrests and dissident groups staged 
peaceful demonstrations several days running at zion and other east 
berlin churches until their comrades were released from prison 
upon leaving the building wegner pointed down the street at two 
dourlooking police officers 
never mind them he says theyre always here

the charge of manslaughter is the 
latest weapon in the fight against heroin in this city of fishermen 
and artists where heroin overdose is the leading cause of death 
among young adults 
there have been 10 overdose deaths in less than 18 months in 
gloucester population 25000 
last week louis catalina 36 a fisherman became the first 
person in the history of massachusetts to be indicted on charges of 
involuntary manslaughter in connection with a drug overdose 
he is accused of supplying a fatal dose of heroin to grace 
randazza 31 the mother of three 
police later arrested frank auditore 41 a stevedore and 
charged him with manslaughter in the death of his sisterinlaw 
anne swanson 33 a former medical secretary and mother of one 
district attorney kevin burke said both women died after 
injecting heroin of exceptional purity to convict on a charge of 
manslaughter a jury must find the defendant provided the drugs 
that caused the death and did so wantonly and recklessly he said 
manslaughter charges carry penalties of up to 20 years in prison 
gloucester is an extraordinary place having perhaps the 
highest per capita number of heroin addicts in the state said 
burke 
it makes gloucester an appropriate place to deliver the 
message that when theres an overdose the supplier just cant walk 
away 
auditore said he has been trying to kick his own drug habit in a 
methadone program he pleaded innocent and was released on bail but 
said he has been evicted from his apartment and shunned by some 
acquaintances since being charged with manslaughter 
im very sorry it happened to her but it was just a matter of 
time she was strung out he said of the death of ms swanson 
theyre trying to scare people so they wont deal he told 
the boston globe they want people to think hey someone might 
die i better not sell this heroin or i might be up for 
manslaughter 
but it wont work heroins got people hooked so bad here 
its never gonna let go its like aids which doesnt scare anyone 
either 
there is no known cure for aids which can be spread by sharing 
contaminated hypodermic needles 
authorities say they arent sure why heroin has made such 
inroads in gloucester 
auditores brother vincent 37 runs a dropin center for 
recovering addicts and said he was one of a small group of young 
men who made the first local heroin connection in 1968 
there arent many still alive who know how it started with a 
couple of guys from boston who came down here in a big lincoln 
continental he said 
there were about 20 of us after that it just mushroomed 
now you stand anywhere long enough in this city someones going 
to ask if youre looking to buy 
police chief earland worthley said overdose deaths began in 
1968 police detectives made 87 heroin arrests last year 300 
percent more than in 1986 and they seized 1020 bags of heroin 
400 percent more than in 1986 
estimates of the number of addicts in the city range as high as 
250 and the annual heroin trade reportedly is at least twice the 
26 million budget of the police department

the crew of a continental airlines jet 
aborted takeoff from washington dulles international airport friday 
after foreign objects entered the jets engines and bent some of 
its turbine blades 
no one was injured as continental flight 581 bound for denver 
with 139 passengers started rolling down the runway and then 
slowed to a stop at about 7 am 
bruce hicks a spokesman for the airline said passengers were 
transferred to other flights 
airline officials at first suspected that ice may have been 
hurled by the wheels into the twin rearmounted engines but hicks 
said that inspections indicated that the problem may have been 
caused by something on the airfield 
visual and hand inspection of the mcdonnell douglas aircraft 
found no ice on the wings or engines before the plane left the gate 
hicks said further testing of the engine blades is planned to 
determine the cause of the incident

two us warships are back to routine 
operations in the black sea after being deliberately bumped by 
soviet vessels in a confrontation off the crimean coast the 
pentagon says 
navy officials said the ships were struck while exercising their 
right to pass through international waters the soviets said the 
us ships violated its border 
and the state department which protested the bumping said the 
incident showed once again that ussoviet relations are a 
continuing blend of the good and the bad in what spokesman rudolph 
boone called a competitive relationship 
he said that undersecretary of state michael armacost summoned 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin to receive a strong us protest and 
that defense secretary frank c carlucci would raise the issue in a 
meeting with soviet officials in bern switzerland next month 
the flareup occurred friday when according to the navy the 
cruiser uss yorktown was deliberately struck by a frigate and the 
destroyer uss caron was deliberately struck by a smaller coastal 
patrol boat 
the two american vessels were exercising their right of 
innocent passage within the 12mile territorial waters claimed 
by the soviets the navy said the navy says its assertion of 
rights program calls for steaming periodically through contested 
waters to emphasize freedom of navigation on the high seas 
the soviet union countered with a charge that the us navy 
ships violated its border ignored warnings and dangerously 
maneuvered in soviet territorial waters 
navy capt gerry flynn gave this account at a pentagon briefing 
the soviets had been shadowing the us vessels since they 
entered the black sea earlier in the week and headed northward to 
the crimean coast 
at about 11 am local time friday or 3 am est the soviets 
broadcast the following warning to the us ships soviet ships 
have orders to prevent violation of territorial waters i am 
authorized to strike your ship with one of ours the caron 
responded i am engaged in innocent passage consistent with 
international law 
the two soviet ships then closed almost simultaneously on the 
american vessels which were as we would say in the navy 
shouldered out of the way 
when neither the caron nor yorktown changed course a 
krivakclass frigate moved up on the yorktown and a mirkaclass 
patrol vessel moved on the caron grazing the left sides of the 
each 
the yorktown and caron maintained their course and speed despite 
the bumping eventually steaming farther from the soviet coast 
flynn concluded by saying the latest report i have now is 
that both ships are operating routinely in the black sea as 
planned 
unlike the united states which claims a threemile territorial 
limit the soviet union claims a 12mile limit along its coast 
said cmdr richard schiff a navy lawyer the united states will 
accept such a claim but any country claiming 12 miles must allow 
for innocent passage by the ships of all nations he said 
a highranking state department official speaking on condition 
of anonymity said that although the department protested soviet 
behavior he did not expect the incident to disturb a ussoviet 
effort to narrow differences on arms control human rights 
regional disputes and bilateral issues 
secretary of state george p shultz is scheduled to go to moscow 
in two weeks to further those efforts and talk about a ussoviet 
summit meeting tentatively scheduled in the soviet capital in the 
spring 
retired rear adm robert j hanks a former director of 
strategic plans and policy for the navy said testing rights of 
passage was an important necessity for the united states but is 
accompanied by risks such as those encountered friday 
he said the two countries set up a commission to discuss such 
incidents under what the navy calls the wrinkled fender 
agreement 
efforts to assess the blame for the latest incident he 
predicted will be a big rhetorical contest with the soviets 
another former admiral eugene carroll who commanded ships in 
the black sea said such incidents are inevitable given the 
conflicting us and soviet goals he said of fridays action 
its really scary

investment in us agriculture will probably 
decline at least through the early 1990s because of the massive tax 
reform act of 1986 according to a new study by the agriculture 
department 
most of the investment decline can be laid to the laws repeal 
of the investment tax credit which allowed up to 10 percent tax 
credit for qualifying capital improvements the report said friday 
most farm machinery equipment many farm structures and certain 
livestock operations qualified for the full 10 percent credit 
the report economic consequences of tax reform on 
agricultural investment was prepared by roger conway ron durst 
james hrubovcak and michael leblanc of the departments economic 
research service 
according to their study there was a decline in net farm 
investment of 29 billion in 1987 with repeal of the investment 
tax credit accounting for 98 percent of the reduction 
the annual reductions are expected to increase gradually through 
1991 when the net disinvestment in agriculture attributable to 
the 1986 law would be almost 35 billion 
elimination of the investment tax credit increases the rental 
rate on farm machinery including tractors and other longlived 
equipment such as cultivators grain harvesters planters plows 
and shredders the report said 
the rental rate of capital is not the most important 
determinant of investment but it and therefore by implication 
tax policy does have a measurable effect on agricultural 
investment the report said 
according to other usda material about the 1986 tax law farmers 
had been claiming more than 1 billion in investment tax credit 
annually one of those background papers noted 
however a large share of this 1 billion a year is claimed 
by individuals with taxable income in excess of 85000 and 
marginal tax rates of 45 percent or above farms with gross 
receipts between 50000 and 500000 per year are able to claim 
less than half of the investment tax credit avabilable to them due 
to no current tax liability 
in its latest report the agency said history suggests that 
changes in the tax code are not permanent and that for example 
the investment tax credit has been revised four times since 1964 
although no reasonable measure of change in the 1986 law can 
alter the current disinvestment of capital in agriculture 1988 
will probably bring forth strident efforts to reinstate the 
investment tax credit the report said

the national association of wheat growers 
wants the agriculture department to ease back on acreage controls 
for the 1989 wheat crop 
frank johannsen association president said friday that greater 
acreage should be permitted so the united states can keep filling a 
growing export demand for the last two years wheat farmers have 
been required to idle 275 percent of their base acreage in order 
to qualify for federal supports 
the usda is to announce the 1989 wheat program by june 1 
johannsen a wheat farmer from bayard neb said the association 
asks the acreage reduction be held to no more than 20 percent 
johannsen said us wheat stockpiles are expected to drop by 30 
percent this season the largest annual decline in more than 20 
years 
a 1989 acreage reduction of less than 20 percent could be 
justified if usda maintains its current export subsidy programs he 
said 
since we dont know what will happen after the november 
elections our market outlook is somewhat cloudy thus making it 
more difficult to forecast export sales opportunities johannsen 
said in a statement released here by the association

price supports for peanuts grown under 1988 
quotas will be 61527 per ton an increase of 780 from last 
year the agriculture department has decided 
deputy secretary peter c myers said friday the increase was 
required by a formula in the law which takes rising production 
costs into consideration 
the annual quota is set at a level equal to the estimated 
quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic edible uses 
seed and related purposes 
production of nonquota peanuts which can be grown for peanut 
oil and meal and for export will be supported at 14975 per ton 
unchanged from last year myers said 
in setting the support for nonquota peanuts officials are 
reqired to consider certain factors including the demand for oil 
and meal the expected prices for other vegetable oils and meals 
and the foreign demand for peanuts

a judge has ruled that suspected terrorist 
fawaz younis may be tried on charges he led the june 1985 hijacking 
of a royal jordanian airliner but not on charges of assaulting 
passengers and blowing up the jet 
us district judge barrington d parker on friday dismissed 
three charges against younis but refused to dismiss six conspiracy 
and hijacking counts of the indictment 
each of the three charges parker dismissed carried potential 
20year sentences and fines of up to 100000 the hijacking 
charges still pending against younis carry life sentences 
parker ruled that the aircraft piracy act of 1984 provided no 
jurisdiction for us authorities to prosecute younis for the 
bombing of the alia jetliner the plane was blown up at beirut 
international airport after the passengers aboard the aircraft had 
been released 
the judge ruled however that the justice department did have 
jurisdiction to prosecute younis on the six other charges of 
conspiracy and hijacking under the hostage taking act also passed 
by congress in 1984 as part of a legislative package to combat 
terrorism the hijacking happened june 11 
that law gives us authorities jurisdiction because three 
americans were aboard the flight when it was stormed in beirut by a 
group of armed men carrying assault rifles and submachine guns 
parker said 
there is no dispute that the only nexus to the united states 
was the presence of several american nationals on board the 
flight parker said the airplane was registered in jordan 
flew the jordanian flag and never landed on american soil or flew 
over american airspace 
the judge said the government didnt have jurisdiction to 
prosecute younis on charges of placing a destructive device aboard 
the plane destroying the plane and assaulting the passengers 
because the alia flight had no connection whatsoever with united 
states territory 
the judge refused to dismiss the six conspiracy and hijacking 
counts of the indictment and upheld the use of navy vessels that 
transported younis following his arrest aboard an fbichartered 
yacht last sept 13 in the mediterranean 
younis who later told the fbi that lebanaons justice minister 
nabih berri approved the hijacking was lured aboard the yacht by 
the prospect of making a drug deal authorities said

a legal victory in a custody fight over the 
bodies of two street people who froze to death will enable an 
advocacy group for the homeless to hold a public funeral and 
24hour protest vigil near city hall 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
on friday upheld a lower court which reversed a city official who 
called the funeral plan an attempt by homeless advocate mitch 
snyder to create a public spectacle 
the threejudge appeals panel upheld us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson who earlier in the day ordered the district of 
columbia to release the bodies to the community for creative 
nonviolence which operates a shelter for the homeless there was 
no immediate information on when the funeral would take place 
our purpose in holding the funeral is not to point the finger 
at the dc government snyder said we are all responsible 
for the plight of the homeless 
during the emergency hearing attorney mark venuti said the 
organization for eight years has been claiming the bodies of all 
homeless people who die of exposure 
dc attorney lutz prager said the group wanted to use the 
bodies for a public spectacle to embarrass the city government 
for not doing enough for homeless people 
the district of columbia has an interest in not having a 
public display of dead bodies prager said 
at the earlier proceeding in us district court jackson told 
city attorneys he had a great deal of difficulty understanding 
how this differs from innumerable presidential funeral corteges 
that have proceeded up pennsylvania avenue since the beginning of 
the country 
noting that the remains would be in closed caskets jackson said 
he saw no legitimate governmental interest in preventing the 
homeless advocates from holding a dignified funeral in a public 
plaza across pennsylvania avenue from the district of columbia 
building 
city officials said they had been unable to find next of kin for 
henry dixon who died jan 2 in a parking attendants booth and an 
undentified woman who was found dead five days later in a 
construction site 
so far 10 homeless people have died on the streets of the 
nations capital this winter

new jersey rep christopher smith stamped 
his foot on the airport tarmac trying to get back the circulation 
in his big toe such is the glamor of the campaign trail 
smith along with more than a dozen other congressmen became a 
potential frostbite victim en route to campaigning for rep jack 
kemp a colleague and fellow conservative republican whos running 
for president 
arriving from washington aboard two cramped chartered planes 
smith and his fellow travelers were unexpectedly warmed by the 
30degree air around this state capitol 
thirty felt good compared with the interiors of the planes 
neither of which had working heaters for the twohour flight the 
congressmen kept their coats on and buried themselves under the 
days new york times 
they came here for a media hit a show of solidarity for 
kemp on the statehouse steps the idea was to give the campaign a 
highprofile booster shot less than a week before the states 
critical firstinthenation primary election 
the idea also was to be pictured with kemp in front of the 
forest of television cameras that has sprouted up in the small town 
square 
the busy congressmen who logged a total of four hours up and 
back in the frigid skies spent about 20 minutes campaigning they 
waved flags and shouted jack is back as kemp predicted victory 
to what at least last week was likely the largest press corps in 
any 30000person town in the world 
smith who has worked nearly a year on kemps behalf saw his 
brief afternoon in new hampshire as time well spent 
like other kemp backers smith says hes encouraged by the 
momentum his candidate has shown here once an also ran the 
buffalo ny congressman claims to be creeping into a position 
just behind gop frontrunners vice president george bush and sen 
bob dole of kansas 
kemp claimed a boost in the iowa precinct cacuses on feb 8 
when republicans handed bush an unexpected and unsettling third 
place dole ran first followed by former tv evangelist pat 
robertson kemp was fourth 
its a new day its a new race he triumphantly told his 
audience composed of friends and reporters and hardly anyone 
else 
its easier around here these days for wouldbe presidents to 
get the attention of a 150000ayear television reporter than to 
attract real live local residents 
but then unlike on most main streets presidential campaign 
offices here are more common than convenience stores as kemp gave 
his speech outside the statehouse dole was shaking hands inside 
bush was expected later 
watching kemps congressmen a full 3 percent of the us house 
of representatives disembark from buses a truck driver sighed 
here they come again 
such political nonchalance reminded smith of his trip to iowa 
for kemp the weekend before smith said he thought iowans would at 
least be startled when a congressman from new jersey knocked at 
their door 
but he quickly found its hard to impress anybody whos had 
pancakes with the vice president

government warehouses that once bulged with 
surplus cheese and other commodities are running out forcing the 
agriculture department to cut off much of its aid to food banks and 
soup kitchens 
rice and honey inventories will be gone next month and cheese 
and nonfat dry milk will be depleted in may said assistant 
secretary john w bode who oversees the departments food and 
consumer services 
flour cornmeal and butter distributions will continue as in 
recent months he said friday cheese nonfat dry milk rice 
and honey distributions will be suspended when we have given it all 
away when we get more we will distribute it 
it comes as no surprise for months operators of local food 
banks and soup kitchens have reported reduced usda donations and 
last november the department predicted that its donations under the 
temporary emergency food assistance program would likely be a 
trickle by spring 
according to department estimates up to 18 million people had 
been getting some free food each month through the program 
the food was accumulated by the departments commodity credit 
corp under various farm price support programs in the case of 
dairy for example the ccc buys surplus butter cheese and nonfat 
dry milk to prop up the price of milk paid to farmers 
but many federal supports have been reduced helping make some 
commodities more competitive on the market instead of winding up in 
government warehouses overseas sales and donations also have 
helped drain off some of the surpluses diversion of many cccowned 
foods into school lunch programs also has reduced the stockpiles 
although variations in surplus stocks cause the size of the 
temporary emergency program to go up and down our regular food 
assistance programs continue bode said lowincome 
americans remain eligible for food stamps free lunches and 
breakfasts elderly food assistance supplemental food programs for 
women infants and children wic child care meals and summer 
child feeding 
more than one of every seven americans receives food assistance 
at some point in the year at a taxpayer cost of more than 56 
million a day he said 
since 1981 approximately five billion pounds of surplus food 
worth more than 5 billion have been distributed through tefap 
bode said

the governing colorado party called 
for a huge turnout to reelect president alfredo stroessner to an 
eighth straight term opponents labeled the elections a farce and 
urged voters to boycott it 
despite criticism from the opposition and the roman catholic 
church stroessner was expected to win sundays presidential 
elections easily 
the president who has announced no formal platform won 901 
percent of the vote in the last elections in 1983 
criticism of the 75yearold army general also came from the 
us state department which said wednesday in its 1987 human 
rights report that paraguay has not had a democratic government 
since its independence in 1811 
the report said stroessner dominates the military the 
political forces the governments bureaucracy and the ruling 
colorado party the oppositions ability to conduct an effective 
campaign is severely restricted 
stroessner son of a bavarian immigrant father and paraguayan 
mother has governed since 1954 longer than any other head of 
state in the western hemisphere 
he faces nominal opposition from candidates of two small 
recognized parties there are 144 million registered voters out 
of a population of 37 million 
the other candidates are rep carlos ferreira ibarra 54 of the 
liberal party and sen luis maria vega 65 of the radical liberal 
party both men accused by other opposition groups of being 
government accomplices admit publicly they cannot win 
current conditions do not guarantee free elections ferreira 
said 
three opposition groups charged that at least 12 of their 
members were arrested thursday for taking part in political acts 
police released most of them friday without explanation 
police late friday left the asuncion home of domingo laino 
president of the unrecognized authentic radical liberal party and 
paraguays leading opposition spokesman for two days they had 
prevented people from entering or leaving the home lainos 
telephone line remained cut 
the elections also include races for the 72 seats in the house 
of deputies and 36 seats in the senate the party winning the 
largest percentage of votes gets twothirds of the seats in 
congress the rest are divided according to the percentage won by 
other parties 
the colorado party is expected to win the majority of 
congressional seats stroessner closed his campaign thursday night 
with a 40minute nationally televised address to 151000 supporters 
by party count in asuncion 
wearing the partys traditional crimson kerchief around his 
neck stroessner recounted his governments achievements in health 
education and public welfare and promised to pay off paraguays 
23 billion foreign debt one of latin americas smallest 
interrupted a dozen times by chants and cheers in spanish and 
guarani the indian language spoken by most paraguayans stroessner 
vowed his government will not share power with minorities who 
call themselves defenders of human rights and embrace the evil and 
bloody servants of international communism 
voter polls conducted late last month by the independent 
asuncion newspaper ultima hora indicate many voters do not even 
know the names of stroessners opponents who together spent less 
than 100000 on their campaign 
a third officially recognized party the febrerista 
revolutionary party has refused to take part in elections since 
1973 saying the voting is rigged 
the main opposition is from the national accord a loose 
grouping of the febreristas and three parties not officially 
recognized the authentic radical liberals the colorado popular 
movement and the christian democrats 
the national accord asked voters to boycott sundays ballot 
election rules require all citizens aged 18 to 60 to vote the 
government said fines and other penalties for failure to vote will 
be enforced 
other critics include members of the colorado partys 
traditional wing ousted from party leadership by a militant 
prostroessner faction at the august party convention the wing 
recommend voters cast blank ballots as a show of disapproval 
the archbishop of asuncion ismael rolon recently told the 
countrys overwhelmingly catholic population it was their duty to 
vote for the candidate of your choice and if none meets your 
expectations then you are free to cast a blank vote 
blank votes are permitted by law but in past elections have 
been included among the uncounted with nullified or spoiled votes 
the colorado party called friday for voters to prove their 
allegiance to stroessner with a massive turnout sunday 
the elections will be observed by official and unofficial 
representatives invited by both the government and the opposition 
including observers from the united states and the european 
parliament

planned payoffs to the government of israel 
and the israeli labor party were mentioned in a 1985 memo to 
attorney general edwin meese iii describing a proposed 1 billion 
iraqi pipeline project according to a swiss businessman who was a 
partner in the plan 
the businessman bruce rappaport said friday in an interview 
with abc news that the memo may have even referred to annual 
payments that were to be given to guarantee the safety of the 
pipeline from israeli attack 
his statement was the first direct confirmation from any of 
those involved in the pipeline project about the contents of the 
memo 
rappaport was a partner in the project with bechtel group inc 
of san francisco rappaport was brought in the project because of 
his 45year relationship with thenisraeli prime minister shimon 
peres rappaport in turn brought in e robert wallach a longtime 
meese friend 
the memo from wallach to meese states that there will be some 
money that will have to be paid to the government of israel and 
either also a certain portion to the labor party and i think he 
even referred to some amounts annually rappaport told abc 
rappaport said he did not intend to pay bribes he called the 
payments standard business procedure and said they would come from 
profits from the pipeline or discounts on the oil 
earlier friday government sources said independent counsel 
james mckay wont publicly release the memo because it might harm 
his investigation of meese 
but if the memo is declassifed the attorney general and his 
lawyers would also have the option of deciding whether to make the 
document public they have said they would first consult mckay on 
the matter 
mckays opposition to releasing the memo comes on the heels of a 
review by an interagency group formed at the behest of the white 
house 
patrick korten a justice department spokesman said he 
understood the group had concluded there was no national security 
reason for keeping the document classified an earlier 
recommendation by the state department had prompted mckay to 
classify the memo 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said however the panel 
was still reviewing hundreds of documents sought by mckay 
mckays office hasnt yet been told officially of the 
interagency groups conclusions in favor of declassification said 
the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
meese said last week he was unable to discuss the contents of 
the document because it was classified 
but meese said that i do not believe that it fairly implies 
that a violation of law was committed or contemplated in connection 
with the pipeline 
meese also says he doesnt recall reading the portion of the 
memo mentioning payments and his involvement in the project was 
entirely lawful proper and responsible 
wallach meeses close friend and former lawyer approached the 
attorney general about the pipeline in may 1985 and meese later 
helped arrange a meeting between wallach and thennational security 
adviser robert mcfarlane on the pipeline which was never built 
peres now foreign minister has denied that anything of value 
was offered or accepted by him or his labor party in connection 
with the pipeline 
the proposed 540mile pipeline was to run near israeli territory 
from iraqs kirkuk oil fields to the jordanian port of aqaba 
fitzwater talking to reporters accompanying president reagan to 
california on air force one denied a report in fridays washington 
post that reagan would order the declassification the president 
does not make this decision he said

alfie flew the coop nearly a week ago 
and macaroni and cheese chicken clucks and feline whines have 
failed to coax him back 
the male mexican yellowheaded parrot remained among the missing 
friday following his escape during a family picnic in the park in 
this southern california city 
he was sitting on top of the station wagon and he said bye 
bye and flew up to one of the pine trees about 35 feet up 
owner susan gabler said 
every morning since alfies escape sunday mrs gabler has been 
strolling through waller park meowing like a cat clucking like a 
chicken and crying like a baby in an effort to lure him home 
when she wasnt making the sounds alfie has learned to mimic 
over the years she was holding out a pot of macaroni and cheese 
the birds favorite meal in hopes the aroma would waft into the 
treetops and entice him to return home to his 200pound wrought 
iron cage 
as they often did the gablers let alfie out of his cage during 
sundays picnic to allow him a taste of freedom alfie took off 
after going home and calling authorities about her escaped pet 
mrs gabler returned to the park where she could hear alfie but 
couldnt see him 
so far mrs gabler hasnt spotted alfies bright yellow head 
red shoulders or green body but she heard him sunday and wednesday 
she said she is worried especially since owls and hawks live in 
the park and are much larger than her twopound pet 
mrs gabler is convinced alfie has survived in the unseasonably 
warm weather feeding on scraps people have dropped for the ducks 
in the park but hes never had to forage for food before she 
added 
she said she and her three children would continue the daily 
hunt for alfie

homeless people are younger more likely to be 
women and less likely to be working than the homeless of a 
generation ago a study shows 
were getting the harvest of the last decades very high 
unemployment rate among minorities said peter rossi a professor 
of sociology at the university of massachusetts in amherst 
rossi who has studied the history of homelessness and collected 
statistics on the current homeless population was to describe his 
findings today at the annual meeting of the american association 
for the advancement of science 
he said at a news conference friday that the average age of the 
homeless in the 1950s was 59 there were virtually no women and 
very few of them slept out on the streets he said 
many stayed in skidrow flophouses if they slept downtown 
the police would pick them up he said 
police policies changed in the 1960s however and arrests for 
vagrancy and public drunkenness dropped rossi said 
about 25 percent of the homeless are now women the result of a 
short supply of eligible working males able to support a household 
the age has dropped enormously rossi said its now 
around 36 very few are over age 65 
one of the most encouraging things i found was the 
disappearance of people over 65 by virtue of the rise in the value 
of social security he said 
few of the homeless are now employed although that varies in 
different areas rossi said in contrast many homeless men were 
able to find day labor in the 1950s 
you might say the forklift truck has depleted the market for 
day work unloading trucks he said 
jon erickson of the state and local expenditure policy 
commission of new jersey said that job training programs have 
helped some homeless people get back to work and have their own 
homes again 
an effort to find jobs for 580 homeless in new jersey was partly 
successful he said about onefourth of them got jobs most were 
employed as security guards clerical workers or in construction 
erickson said eightyfour percent earned less than 7 per hour 
rossi has found that the proportion of homeless who come from 
minority groups has risen in new york city for example 85 
percent of the homeless are black or hispanic 
estimates of the total number of homeless in the united states 
vary from 250000 to several million rossi said he guesses and 
emphasized that he is only guessing that the low estimates are 
nearer to the truth 
some of the homeless rossi said are adults with relatives who 
might support them but those relatives are often so close to being 
impoverished themselves that they cannot support adult dependents 
no matter how generous they might want to be

a new production of siegfried a new tenor 
to sing it and a superlative performance by the entire cast filled 
the evening at the metropolitan opera on friday 
wolfgang neumann scheduled to make his met debut as siegfried 
on feb 20 made it instead on the first night of the new 
siegfried production because peter hofmann had a bronchial 
infection and withdrew 
neumann from kaernten austria a member of the mannheim opera 
in germany has a golden voice it isnt the kind with a golden 
pinging edge but a full rich voice which remained freshsounding 
through this long part 
neumann didnt hold back in the first two acts as some tenors 
do for his duets with brunnhilde in act 3 neumann sounded 
innocent as siegfried should and he looked like an attractive 
large country boy 
hildegard behrens sang glowingly as brunnhilde her top notes 
sounding effortless and tender never blaring 
otto schenk directed the meeting of siegfried and brunnhilde 
well they must do a lot of singing before they embrace schenk has 
siegfried exhibit much wonderment circling the rock on which he 
found brunnhilde 
we liked the direction of mime less horst hiestermann sang the 
part well but several times skipped about too frivolously for such 
a villain 
also the dragon in a suddenly darkened act 2 was unpleasantly 
startling in a production which has siegfried in act 1 forge a 
broken sword with meticulous realism it was a frightening monster 
waving various ugly heads out from several holes in a rock wall 
anne gjevang had a sweet though hooded tone as erda she 
appeared in an otherworldly blue light to sing with the wanderer 
donald mcintyre sounded wise and sympathetic as the wanderer 
his voice did not tire 
james levine conducted taking the overture very slowly and 
making the most of every nuance note and pause most of the 
evening was taken at a faster pace though there were other places 
where levine slowed the tempo 
gunther schneidersiemsen designed the sets which included 
wonderful deep forests

an iraqi jet bomber fired a longrange 
cruise missile within eight miles of the destroyer chandler friday 
night as the vessel escorted a convoy of four tankers according to 
a media pool report 
the chandler was not the apparent target or the attack and there 
were no reported injuries 
iraqi planes occasionally have hit by mistake fishing trawlers 
and last may 17 struck the frigate uss starke killing 37 american 
sailors 
iraq said saturday its warplanes raided a very large maritime 
target off irans gulf coast on friday night in iraqi military 
terminology a very large maritime target usually means a 
supertanker sailing off irans coast 
the pentagon media pool report released in washington said an 
iraqi jet bomber on friday night fired a longrange cruise missile 
within eight miles of the destroyer uss chandler as it was 
escorting a convoy of four reflagged kuwaiti tankers to kuwaits 
oil terminals 
although the chandler and its convoy were not the apparent 
targets of the missile attack the destroyer fired two flares from 
its 5inch guns to warn the iraqi badger bomber that it was 
approaching too close to the us warship said the pool report 
filed by norman kempster of the los angeles times newspaper 
the official iraqi news agency quoting a military spokesman 
reported saturday that iraqi warplanes struck at a very large 
maritime target off the iranian coast scoring an accurate and 
effective hit and returned safely to base 
the agency monitored in cyprus said the attack took place at 
908 pm friday 108 am est friday it gave no other details 
cmdr steve smith captain of the chandler said he was 
concerned because iraqi pilots often fire at radar blips without 
making sure what their targets really are 
having watched the geometry of their attacks for some time i 
was concerned that he would be firing his missile while he was 
heading toward us smith said over the ships public address 
system after the incident ended 
later smith told a small group of reporters who boarded the 
ship as part of the pentagons persian gulf press pool that the 
iraqi pilot fired two sovietmade c601 missiles a 50mile range 
airlaunched version of the styx which china copied in producing 
its far betterknown silkworms 
smith said both missiles passed astern of the chandler the last 
ship in the convoy but that one of the rockets suddenly changed 
course and passed along the starboard side of the ship before 
veering away to the right 
seconds later it detonated producing a bright flash on the 
horizon there was no immediate indication whether the missile had 
hit a target or had crashed harmlessly into the sea 
smith said it was the closest approach of a missile to his ship 
which has been on station in the persian gulf since nov 25 the 
chandler one of four guided missile destroyers originally produced 
for iran during the reign of the shah but never delivered is the 
flagship of the navys tanker escort squadron which includes six 
frigates 
ensign brian josse of kilua hawaii the officer of the deck 
when the incident began said later weve seen iraqi planes come 
close but never this close 
quartermaster 2nd class dave markee of salem ore who was 
manning a 50caliber machine gun on the starboard side of the ship 
said we believe we saw the missile separate from the jet we 
also saw antiaircraft fire off our stern 
smith placed his crew on general quarters the navys 
highest state of alert after the badger which had earlier passed 
the convoy on a flight south along the gulf from iraq turned back 
north and headed straight for the chandler 
smith said he was prepared to try to shoot down the incoming 
missile if it had appeared to be on a course that would strike any 
ship in the convoy he readied the standard1 antiaircraft 
missile shoulderfired stinger missiles and the automaticfiring

the presidential campaigns began turning 
bitter on the final weekend before the new hampshire primary with 
jack kemp denouncing a pat robertson commercial as a lie and 
richard gephardt saying a paul simon ad questions his integrity 
the public schedules of the campaigns were snarled by a massive 
snow storm friday but the reality that the first 1988 primary will 
end some candidates hopes heated up the rhetoric 
for one republican alexander haig the campaign ended friday 
as he withdrew in the face of certain defeat 
for one longshot democrat bruce babbitt friday was the time 
to ask voters to prolong a campaign offering vastly different ideas 
from those of his rivals 
let me be direct even blunt new hampshire has the power of 
life or death over my campaign babbitt told a state party 
dinner i dont expect to win the new hampshire primary but what 
i do need to do what you need to do is to send a message to the 
rest of america that here in the snowy hills of new england a 
message of courage and challenge and hope was kept alive 
in the final 72 hours before the primary vote begins the 
airwaves in new hamsphire are filled with campaign commercials and 
those ads started sharp exchanges 
kemp his chance for at least a moral victory here threatened by 
robertsons surge demanded that the former television evangelist 
withdraw television commercials and printed fliers that contained 
deliberate distortions 
i cant insist that all candidates abide by ronald reagans 
11th commandment not to speak ill of another republican kemp 
said in an address to the conservative political action committee 
in washington 
but all of us should abide by the ninth commandment thou 
shalt not bear false witness he said to prolonged cheers 
robertson snowbound in merrimack nh said this is the 
kind of desperate thing that losers begin to do we didnt put 
out any of this stuff hes talking about 
four of the democratic candidates simon gephardt babbitt and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis showed up for a new hampshire 
state party fundraising dinner sen albert gore jr of tennessee 
and jesse jackson had planned to be back in the state but could 
not make it due to the snow former colorado sen gary hart did not 
plan to attend the dinner 
but the fraternal nature of the evening did not stop the 
bickering 
turning to simon and gephardt dukakis asked you guys getting 
along anything i can do to help 
the audience of activists laughed as many understood the 
bickering between the no 2 and no 3 contenders has done nothing 
to hurt dukakis 
after the dinner the trading of barbs between simon and 
gephardt blew up 
enough is enough on these negative ads gephardt told 
reporters paul simon is running an ad that ought to come off the 
television it impugns my character and my integrity by saying can 
you trust this man 
so to put it very straight enough is enough i asked sen 
simon to take those ads off television and if he doesnt he ought 
to take off the bow tie because hes just another politician as 
long as theyre on the missouri congressman said 
only moments before simon had told reporters that drawing out 
the distinctions between the candidates is legitimate 
as long as it doesnt get too acrimonious i think that a 
healthy comparison is good simon said 
gephardt promised to renew the exchange at the final debate 
before the primary a confrontation sponsored by the league of 
women voters this afternoon at st anselm college 
the daily polling of the sentiments of the new hampshire voters 
continued without pause with vice president george bush locked in 
a neckandneck race with kansas sen bob dole 
one survey the abc newswashington post poll taken thursday 
night showed bush with 32 percent to doles 26 percent another 
the cbs news poll taken wednesday and thursday gave the kansas 
senator 32 percent to bushs 29 percent 
the cbs poll was based on interviews with 499 likely gop primary 
voters and had a sampling error margin of 4 percentage points the 
abcwashington post poll interviewed 559 likely republican voters 
and had a margin of error of 5 percentage points 
in both polls dukakis maintained a strong lead in the 
democratic race

bell atlantic has formally told the general 
services administration that it won two government 
telecommunications projects honestly and without any information 
regarding any other offerors bid 
in a brief filed friday with the gsas board of contract 
appeals bell atlantic said it should be awarded the contracts 
despite a complaint of improprieties in the bidding process 
the fact is bell atlantic won its contracts the 
oldfashioned way by bidding superior services at significantly 
lower prices than those proposed by atampt the brief said 
the general services administration began investigating the 
awarding of a total of 55 million in contracts after atampt 
complained last october that information on atampts pricing 
information was leaked to competitors 
bell atlantic asked the gsa board to rule that atampts 
allegations are incorrect in connection with the awarding of 
contracts to bell atlantic for electronic switches in washington 
dc and philadelphia 
hearings on atampts protest are scheduled to begin feb 16 
the senate governmental affairs committee which has 
investigated atampts allegations has said its probe found that 
sureshar l soni a gsa employee leaked secret information from 
atampts bids to at least two competing telephone companies 
bell atlantic maintained in its brief that its prices never 
changed it said it submitted its initial bids of 1840 per month 
for connection to a switch in washington and 3050 in philadelphia 
on april 1 1987 and those bids remained unchanged on the final 
dates for bids of aug 19 in washington and july 29 in philadelphia

the 12nation european economic 
community today ended months of financial crisis approving an 
agricultural reform package that for the first time limits farm 
spending 
the deal to control although not end the communitys 
burgeoning agricultural surpluses was reached in the early hours 
averting virtual bankruptcy for the trade bloc later this year 
i think it was better to try to strain for agreement today 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain looking tired told 
reporters her country had made major concessions 
the emergency summit which began thursday was the third 
highlevel attempt in eight months to solve the communitys 
financial woes the eec had operated without a budget since 
december 
mrs thatcher long isolated by her european partners over 
finances dropped major demands for austerity in the face of 
persistent opposition headed by france 
the summit was marked by particularly angry clashes between mrs 
thatcher and french premier jacques chirac 
mrs thatcher termed absolutely crazy french insistence that 
production quotas on cheaper commodities be referred to a foreign 
ministers meeting instead of agreed upon at the summit in an 
acrosstheboard deal 
britain and the netherlands endorsed the package which dealt 
with the most expensive crops on condition the foreign ministers 
approve curbs on the lesser commodities which was virtually 
certain 
it was the first time in the eecs 31year history that leaders 
fixed a limit to farm spending which eats up twothirds of the 
eecs annucal budget 
the agreement set a 344 billion limit on farm spending in 
1988 slightly higher than last year this can rise by no more than 
25 billion over five years mrs thatcher had wanted a 338 
billion limit for 1988 and a smaller increase in the years ahead 
west germany the eec chairman and france had wanted a 369 
billion limit 
also the leaders agreed to limit grain production to 160 
million metric tons a year compared with 155 million tons demanded 
by britain and the netherlands 
mrs thatcher said her concession was partly offset by a 9 
percent automatic price cut over three years for grain production 
that exceeds the ceiling 
the agreement also set strict production quotas on oilseeds 
closer to british demands 
the eec leaders agreed to raise by 80 percent over the next five 
years regional aid to spain portugal greece and ireland the 
poorest members spain had sought a 100 percent rise compared with 
a 50 percent rise favored by the rich northern states including 
britain france and west germany 
the increase will bring regional aid to 1625 billion by 1992 
in addition to reducing expenditures the summit agreed to tap 
new revenues by basing membership dues on the relative wealth of 
member states rather than sales taxes only italy with a large 
economy which isnt reflected in sales tax returns would have to 
pay more 
the agreement was widely seen as sending a signal to the united 
states to rein in its agricultural production 
i hope fervently that our friends across the ocean do 
their share to control their agricultural spending said dutch 
prime minister ruud lubbers

richard gephardt angrily demanded that 
rival presidential aspirant paul simon take attack 
advertisements off the airwaves or take off the bow tie that 
is the illinois senators trademark 
simon responded we may be changing ads but were not going 
to do it in response to his request 
gephardt aides meanwhile said they would unveil new ads today 
responding to simons spots but they declined to give details 
three days before the first primary of the 1988 presidential 
season gephardt also turned up the heat friday on massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis who holds a commanding lead in new hampshire 
polls 
if the state of the state of massachusetts that he gave this 
year becomes the state of the union next year americans 
individual income taxes are going to go up gephardt said at an 
impromptu news conference after a state democratic party dinner 
but gephardt was most bitter toward simon the illinois senator 
this week began airing ads on television and radio that point out 
inconsistencies in gephardts record as a missouri congressman 
and question his trustworthiness 
gephardt and simon have acknowledged they essentially are 
fighting to place second in new hampshire simon on friday 
acknowledged that a poor thirdplace showing would force him to 
consider dropping out of the race 
simon gephardt dukakis and former arizona gov bruce babbitt 
addressed the democrats dinner dukakis standing between simon 
and gephardt joked you guys getting along anything i could do 
to help 
simon did not mention the dispute in his speech but gephardt 
said ive been attacked lately in this campaign and thats okay 
with me he cited criticism by simon and dukakis of his votes for 
taxreform bills in 1981 and 1986 and said i did it i really 
did it i voted to cut your taxes 
i just want paul and mike to know that when this is all over 
were going to be friends and if they keep telling people that im 
a tax cutter then were going to be even better friends than we 
are today gephardt said 
afterward simon met with reporters and said of the dispute with 
gephardt as long as it doesnt get too acrimonious i think a 
healthy comparison is good for the electorate both here in new 
hampshire and around the nation 
but minutes later gephardt held his own news conference and 
escalated his attacks saying simons ad impugns my character and 
my integrity by saying can you trust this man 
ive never impugned paul simons character ive disagreed 
with a lot of his crazy ideas but i have never once questioned 
paul simons motives or his integrity or whether he could be 
trusted gephardt said 
i asked sen simon to take those ads off television and if he 
doesnt he ought to take off the bow tie because hes just another 
politician as long as theyre on 
gephardts campaign counsel earlier sent telegrams to television 
stations in boston manchester nh and portsmouth maine saying 
simons ads contain a savage and willfully inaccurate attack 
and asking stations either to discontinue the attack 
advertisements or sell gephardt time for a response ad 
the counsel bob bauer said the stations have generally agreed 
to sell gephardt such time for the ad which will begin running 
today gephardt aides would not describe the ads contents

federal reserve policymakers decided in 
december that the easing of credit instituted by the fed after the 
october stock market plunge was no longer needed according to 
minutes of the meeting 
the minutes released friday showed that the majority argued in 
favor of ending efforts to push interest rates lower also because 
of concerns about the decline of the dollar 
lower us interest rates put downward pressure on the value of 
the dollar because foreigners earn less on their dollardenominated 
investments 
the action was approved at a scheduled meeting of the federal 
open market committee on dec 15 and 16 and reaffirmed during an 
unannounced telephone conference call fed officials held on jan 5 
immediately following the record 508point drop in stock prices 
on oct 19 federal reserve chairman alan greenspan promised that 
the central bank would do everything necessary to ensure that the 
economy had sufficient credit to weather the oneday loss of 500 
billion in wealth 
the december action was approved on a vote of 92 while the 
reaffirmation of the policy in january carried by a 101 vote 
martha seger dissented both times arguing that financial 
markets remained too unsettled to justify a shift away from 
easier credit 
since the december meeting the dollar has stabilized in part 
because of massive intervention by the fed and other central banks 
to prop up the currencys value on foreign exchange markets 
fed policymakers met again tuesday and wednesday amid 
speculation by some private economists that the central bank has 
launched further easing moves these economists noted that a 
variety of interest rates including mortgage rates have been 
headed lower in recent weeks

presidents reagan and miguel de la 
madrid meet in this carnivalbedecked pacific resort today to 
discuss how to increase trade in legal goods and reduce traffic of 
illegal drugs 
reagan accompanied by attorney general edwin meese commerce 
secretary c william verity and secretary of state george p 
shultz will be in mexico about four hours 
reagan will have a meeting and lunch with de la madrid in a 
luxurious seaside hotel within earshot of those celebrating the 
traditional roman catholic prelenten carnival 
it will be the sixth meeting between the two presidents who 
according to their aides have developed a good working personal 
relationship both are in their last year in office 
tight security measures by both countries have not interfered 
with the festival atmosphere of this port city of nearly 300000 
residents 
the leaders will be welcomed by the flags of both nations and 
bunting proclaiming mazatlan a city of friendship 
verity shultz and meese will meet with their mexican 
counterparts to discuss top matters of common concern trade 
foreign policy and the illegal drug trade 
mexico struggling with a serious economic crisis now in its 
seventh year is making efforts to expand nonoil exports to the 
united states it also is trying to lower its own tariffs on us 
products 
the mexicans however have made it clear they are not ready to 
join the united states and canada in a north american free trade 
zone 
unfortunately mexicos most successful exports to the us 
market are those the two countries want to stop drugs 
mexico has become a relay point for south american cocaine going 
to the united states and a major supplier of marijuana and heroin 
also shipped to the us market the state of sinaloa of which 
mazatlan is the secondlargest city is where much of the marijuana 
is produced in mexico 
us officials have often criticized mexican efforts to fight 
drugs as inefficient and hampered by official corruption 
mexico counters that 60 percent of the budget of its federal 
attorney generals office is used to fight drug traffic and 
complains the problem would not be as serious if there wasnt such 
a market for drugs in the united states 
mexicos foreign policy often at odds with that of the united 
states especially when it comes to central america will be a 
minor topic of discussion 
neither one is going to change said a us source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
in the end trade will dominate the talks 
mexico and the united states have worked out trade agreements 
dealing with steel textiles shoes and beer the presidents are 
expected to formalize some of those agreements during their meeting 
one us source said us companies would invest more in mexico 
if it could make itself more attractive by offering flexible 
legislation when it comes to ownership mexico generally demands 
majority stock in all joint ventures 
us investments in mexico represent 2 percent of the total 
value of mexicos industrial plant and equipment

georgetown university which has waged a 
thusfar unsuccessful legal battle to avoid supporting homosexual 
groups on campus has agreed to treat such organizations the same 
as it does other student groups 
the university agreed friday to give homosexual student groups 
equal treatment a district of columbia court of appeals ruling 
late last year had said the university must offer homosexual 
organizations the same tangible benefits given other student 
groups although it did not have to officially recognize them 
the university had said that treating homosexual organizations 
on campus with equality would violate its conscience as a roman 
catholic institution church teachings do not support homosexual 
acts 
georgetowns announcement friday came one day after the dc 
office of human rights said it would launch a major 
investigation into the universitys treatment of homosexual 
groups after three students complained that it had not fully 
complied with a court ruling 
university spokesman gary krull said its action had nothing to 
do with the human rights office investigation and the decision 
was made before the university learned of the probe 
krull also said the decision does not prejudice our ability to 
file a formal request for the us supreme court to review the 
case last month the high court twice rejected georgetowns 
request to stay the appeals court ruling 
krull said georgetown would give gay organizations on its law 
school and main campus the same things it offers to any group 
and would not restrict its assistance to four items specifically 
mentioned by the appeals court a mailbox computerized label 
service mailing services and an opportunity to apply for 
university funds 
law school dean robert pitofsky said the broader list of 
services and facilities that will be available to the lesbian and 
gay association of georgetown university law students includes 
photocopying telephones stationery meeting and party rooms and 
offices

to promote peace in central america the 
united states should immediately lift its trade embargo against 
nicaragua and stop blocking loans to the sandinista government 
said costa ricas ambassador to this country 
ambassador guido fernandez said washingtons tactic of financing 
contra rebels to force the leftist sandinista government to allow 
democracy in nicaragua has failed and that other means should be 
used to achieve that goal 
the contras have received 300 million from the united states 
from both official and unofficial sources but they have made no 
gains fernandez said in a speech friday night at rockhurst 
college 
the presidents of nicaragua el salvador honduras costa rica 
and guatemala signed a regional peace plan last august in guatemala 
city 
it calls for an end to outside support for insurgencies in 
central america and calls on the signatories to take specific steps 
to allow democracy to flourish in their countries 
the plan also calls for ceasefires amnesty for political 
prisoners and an end to the use of one countrys territory to 
launch attacks on a neighbor 
fernandez said washington should make concessions now that the 
us congress has denied president reagans request to send 
military aid to the contras 
now that we have withheld the stick why not use the carrot 
more fernandez asked 
the reagan administration has said it is following a twotrack 
policy toward nicaragua by applying military and diplomatic 
pressure but fernandez said he has only seen the use of military 
pressure by washington 
where is the other track of the twotrack policy he asked 
we would like to see it 
fernandez said the united states should immediately lift its 
trade embargo against nicaragua he said in comments after his 
address that washington should stop blocking loans by the 
interamerican development bank to nicaragua 
costa rican president oscar arias was awarded the 1987 nobel 
peace prize for being the architect of the peace plan many members 
of the us house said they voted against military aid to the 
contras earlier this month to give arias plan a chance to work 
fernandez said that if the united states grants the concessions 
he mentioned they always could be reversed if the sandinistas fail 
to live up to the plans provisions 
as part of the plan the sandinistas and the contras have 
initiated meetings to agree on a ceasefire fernandez said that if 
a ceasefire is established in nicaragua the united states should 
then negotiate directly with the sandinistas to address us 
security concerns

the soviet union today exploded a nuclear device 
underground the official tass news agency reported indicating the 
device may have had a yield seven times greater than that of the 
atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima 
tass said the nuclear test was staged at 605 am moscow time 
1005 pm est friday with a view to upgrading military 
technology it gave no further details 
the test at the main soviet test range of semipalatinsk in the 
central asian republic of kazakhstan was the second soviet nuclear 
test explosion this year a device was detonated at semipalatinsk 
on feb 6 
tass said the latest nuclear explosion had a yield of between 20 
and 150 kilotons 
the us atom bomb dropped on hiroshima japan on aug 6 1945 
had a yield of 20 kilotons or the equivalent of 20000 tons of tnt 
the superpowers are holding negotiations in geneva aimed at 
developing a method of verifying the yields of nuclear tests and 
working out a possible test ban 
in january a delegation of american researchers and officials 
visited the semipalatinsk range about 2000 miles southeast of 
moscow to gather information that may be used in verifying 
ussoviet nuclear test agreements 
in april the americans will use their methods to measure the 
yield of a soviet nuclear blast at semipalatinsk at the same time 
the soviets will use their techniques to calculate the yield of a 
us nuclear test at the american test site in nevada

an elderly landlord shackled by an electronic 
manacle brought new furniture and a security guard into his rundown 
apartment building as he began a courtordered stay for failing to 
fix leaky pipes and other problems 
greeted by angry tenants and a banner reading welcome you 
reptile morris gross 77 began serving a 15day house arrest 
friday in a brooklyn building where tenants complain of bugs and 
rodents leaky ceilings and a lack of heat and hot water 
gross who lives in a luxury highrise in the brighton beach 
section of brooklyn made no comment to a group of tenants who 
shouted at him as he walked into the lobby wearing sunglasses and a 
gray scarf around his face 
we ask for so many things and they dont do anything said 
errol ramdeo who lives in apartment 5a 
ramdeo said the door to the apartment where he lives with his 
parents is off its hinges bathroom tiles are falling off the wall 
and their stove doesnt work 
a civil court judge convicted gross of criminal and civil 
contempt in december after the city department of housing 
preservation and development brought action against him for failing 
to comply with a court order to correct housing violations 
the judge gave him the choice of either paying 169000 in fines 
for 420 violations or serving 15 days of house arrest and spending 
137900 of the fines to repair the 113unit building in brooklyns 
flatbush neighborhood 
gross will be confined to a fifthfloor apartment his movements 
monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet to make sure he serves 
his sentence 
when asked why gross chose house arrest his attorney stanley 
kopilow said the landlord wanted to show to the judge and the 
community that this is not as bad as portrayed in the press 
on thursday night after gross decision was announced workers 
began repairs on apartment 5c including painting and plastering 
walls and installing new kitchen tiles 
friday morning delivery men unloaded a new couch recliner 
chair and bureau from a truck which they said were to be delivered 
to gross onebedroom apartment 
gross meals will be catered tenants said and he will have a 
private security guard with him in the apartment for the duration 
of his sentence 
lawrence carelli the hpd attorney who handled the case said 
the only other case he knew in which a landlord was sentenced to 
live in his own building involved a 30day sentence handed down in 
los angeles last year 
he said there were still 400 outstanding violations in gross 
building some dating back five years 
joyce stewart president of the tenants association pointed 
out a large hole in the ceiling of one apartment from which water 
comes down like crazy 
another tenant vivian murray complained of flaking paint chips 
which she has discovered her 2yearold daughter eating 
building superintendent sydney pilgrim while conceding that 
gross is not an angel said the landlord had spent 1 million 
to repair the building 
we know he should not have let the building run down so far 
but work is getting done pilgrim said 
ms stewart countered that cosmetic repairs had been done on 
only 10 to 12 apartments 
when you subtract that from 113 apartments youll see the 
real mccoy she said

many foods contain very high levels of natural 
cancercausing agents suggesting that intense efforts to control 
industrial carcinogens may be misplaced a researcher said 
apples for example contain high levels of formaldehyde which 
is considered to be a potent carcinogen said bruce ames chairman 
of the biochemistry department at the university of california 
berkeley 
broccoli contains a substantial amount of a substance that is 
chemically similar to dioxin peanut butter is unavoidably 
contaminated with a fungus that is highly carcinogenic 
does that mean were being done in by vegetables well thats 
what the reality is turning out to be ames said friday at the 
annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of 
science 
ames said he does not in fact believe that the cancercausing 
agents in food are causing us harm because we have evolved to 
defend ourselves against those agents 
he believes however that the defenses we have evolved also 
protect us against industrial carcinogens which cause cancer in 
the same ways as do natural carcinogens 
peter preuss director of the office of health and environmental 
assessment at the us environmental protection agency said i 
think theres a great deal of importance in what professor ames 
said 
he was critical however of many of amess calculations 
while the idea is important im disturbed by the details i 
think theres a lot of rigor that has to be introduced into that 
science before its accepted 
he noted for example that the dioxinlike substance in 
broccoli might act differently than dioxin there are a lot of 
things that are like that but nevertheless dioxin is unique 
he said 
ames said most of the natural carcinogens in plants evolved as a 
natural defense mechanism 
plants dont have teeth they dont have claws they cant run 
away he said all plant evolution is plants developing new and 
better toxins to fight off predators 
ames began his talk by saying that the world is full of 
carcinogens but that they are not as harmful as people believe 
one line of evidence to support that he said is that with a 
few exceptions rates of cancer have not increased in the 
industrial era 
except for lung cancer which is due to cigarette smoking 
rates of cancer are staying steady or going down he said 
while that is true for some cancers preuss said others have 
gone up they include melanoma lymphoma and cancer of the testes 
prostate and kidney 
ames was critical of the use of rats and mice to test whether 
substances are carcinogenic its reasonable to think that 
chemicals that are carcinogens in mice and rats would be 
carcinogens in people but the hook is at that dose 
rats are given the maximum dose that wont poison them he said 
but such doses can kill cells in the body and may lead to cancer 
simply through the disruption they cause if that were the case 
the substances would not be expected to cause cancer at the low 
doses that humans might be exposed to he said 
ames is the developer of an alternative test that uses bacteria 
to identify possible carcinogens 
ames presented dozens of examples of carcinogens in plants 
celery for example contains psoralens which become carcinogenic 
when exposed to light the levels are so high that celery pickers 
often develop a rash on their hands and arms as a result ames said 
potatoes have high levels of solanine and chaconine which block 
the action of a human enzyme called cholinesterase he said 
organophosphate pesticides are considered dangerous said ames 
because they do the same thing block cholinesterase

one day last year every person on earth was 
bombarded with 10000 billion ghostly particles called neutrinos 
hurled into space by the explosion of a star an astronomer said 
however neutrinos are so incredibly small and elusive that they 
passed through buildings people and the earth itself with barely a 
trace besides said boston university astronomer larry sulak we 
are recycled star dust 
the neutrinos are the remnants of a supernova an exploding 
star that suddenly appeared almost a year ago in the skies of the 
southern hemisphere 
such explosions happen regularly but this one was in the large 
magellanic cloud a galaxy 1 million trillion miles away which is 
close by heavenly standards it is the brightest from an earthly 
perspective in 383 years 
scientists who have spent the past year studying the supernova 
discussed their findings friday at a meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science 
john bahcall of the institute for advanced study in princeton 
nj said that last feb 23 every human on earth was showered 
with about 10000 billion neutrinos from the exploding star 
however people are constantly bombarded with neutrinos from our 
own sun as well and the added dose did no harm 
only 1 in 10000 had as much as a single hydrogen atom changed 
by the neutrinos bahcall said 
the subatomic particles have almost zero mass and no charge 
he said the supernova explosion was the equivalent of about one 
million billion billion billion atomic bombs of the kind that 
destroyed hiroshima thats more energy than a hundred stars 
shining like the earths sun would give off in light over the 
lifetime of the universe 
scientists at the conference said they were surprised and 
delighted that the supernova acted almost exactly like their 
theories said it would 
it was expected to make neutrinos and it did right on 
schedule said j craig wheeler of the university of texas in 
austin the basic predictions have come to pass with this 
supernova 
the researchers said that when the star blew up 99 percent of 
its exploding energy was released in the form of neutrinos while 
most of the rest was light the neutrinos reached earth three hours 
before the light that light spotted from a mountain top in chile 
last feb 24 was the first sign for astronomers of the celestial 
catastrophe 
later though scientists found traces of the sudden burst of 
neutrinos in two huge vats of water one in the united states and 
one in japan 
sulak operates the us experiment a square tank of water five 
stories high that sits in a salt mine beneath lake erie the tank 
was built for another purpose witnessing the death of protons 
but it also showed that eight neutrinos from the supernova had 
collided with water molecules the japanese tank recorded 11 such 
collisions 
the experts believe that nickel was formed during the initial 
explosion this decayed in about five days to form radioactive 
cobalt which in turn more slowly breaks down to make iron the 
cobalt gives off both light and gamma rays 
robert p kirshner of the harvardsmithsonian center for 
astrophysics said the steady dimming of the supernova has recently 
begun to accelerate this is because it is spewing out more of its 
energy as gamma rays and less as light however the destroyed star 
is still visible with binoculars 
supernovas are important to people because they are the source 
of many elements that are essential to life 
this is the death of a star said kirshner this is the 
place where the elements are made the calcium in your bones was 
made in a supernova explosion

the state department is expressing interest in 
the efforts of three eastern european countries to buy usmade 
passenger planes but cautions there may be some stumbling blocks 
deputy secretary of state john c whitehead said friday the 
three countries which he declined to identify have begun talks 
with the boeing and mcdonnell douglas aircraft companies to supply 
longrange passenger planes to replace aging soviet equipment in 
their national airlines 
another official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
countries involved were poland hungary and romania 
whitehead said that from the state departments viewpoint the 
sales would be feasible and desirable but he noted two 
potential problems 
buying us aircraft would require large expenditures by the 
governments and credits from the us exportimport bank for the 
purchases would not be available whitehead said 
the aircraft companies moreover would be prohibited from 
selling equipment on a list of militaryapplicable goods banned for 
export to communist countries this could limit the type of 
airplanes the countries could buy

the government is reviewing use of the 
insecticide dichlorvos common in flykilling pest strips and other 
applications in the wake of studies on laboratory animals that 
show the chemical may cause cancer and liver damage 
a special review such as that announced friday by the 
environmental protection agency could lead to fewer or more 
restrictions a ban on the product or its exoneration 
some 2 million pounds of dichlorvos are used in about 800 
products every year about 25 percent is used on farm crops 35 
percent on livestock 25 percent in commercial and industrial 
buildings and on lawns and ornamental crops and 15 percent in 
homes and on pets epa said 
dichlorvos has been used since 1948 against flies mosquitoes 
gnats cockroaches and other insects

a federal judge says the environmental 
protection agency hasnt produced any evidence to back its 
assertion that distribution of remaining stocks of the pesticide 
chlordane wont cause undue harm 
us district judge louis f oberdorfer said friday the epa 
hadnt legally proven it can authorize the retail sale of small 
amounts of the pesticide chlordane as part of a deal to ultimately 
take the antitermite chemical off the market 
the agencys latest court filing does not satisfy federal law 
which requires the epa to determine that a pesticide will not 
unreasonably harm the environment he said 
the epa believes that chlordane causes cancer to avoid a 
protracted battle with 197 distributors the agency has agreed to 
let them sell chlordane already in stock in return the companies 
are argeeing to cancellation of their licenses to sell the 
pesticide

the navy and pentagon say they cant explain 
why they didnt honor a widows request to withhold public 
announcement that a military laboratory had identified the remains 
of her husband who died in the vietnam war 
the widow erna mckinney of san diego calif said in a 
telephone interview she had asked that the identification be 
withheld because she wanted to obtain a second opinion to verify 
the militarys forensic work 
the navy acknowledged late friday that due to an oversight 
the remains of navy lt clemie mckinney an aviator who was lost 
over south vietnam on april 14 1972 had been transported from 
hawaii to california this week without informing mrs mckinney 
i told them i didnt want them to release the identification 
because i wasnt prepared to accept the finding that i wanted a 
second opinion said mrs mckinney 
all i can say is that we routinely abide by the familys 
desires on that point said lt col keith schneider if we had 
been aware of that request here at the pentagon we would have 
made sure the identification was not released publicly

industrialist victor posner must design a 3 
million project to aid the homeless and work in a downtown shelter 
for vagrants as part of an unusual sentence for tax evasion 
us district judge eugene p spellman told the 69yearold 
tycoon friday that he would have served some of the maximum 40year 
prison term he had faced had posner not offered to make a large 
contribution of time and money instead 
posner whose worth is estimated at more than 240 million 
pleaded no contest sept 29 to evading more than 12 million in 
federal taxes by inflating the value of land he donated to a bible 
college as a tax exemption 
if i didnt have the alternative youve given me mr posner 
then i would turn to the only alternative the law gives me 
spellman said that is incarceration 
at your age i doubt youd be in jail more than six to nine 
months regardless of the sentence he said 
spellman also warned posner not one dollar of the funds of 
this project are taxdeductible 
the sentence also includes five years probation 5000 hours of 
community service 4 million in back taxes penalties and interest 
and a 75000 fine 
posner must spend six months with a committee of experts 
studying the plight of the homeless in south florida design 
solutions and then pay a minimum of 3 million to implement them 
his sentence begins immediately spending five hours a week for the 
next 60 days at the camillus house shelter for the homeless 
posner fended off questions after the hearing but responded when 
asked if the sentencing plan was his idea 
ive been involved in charitable work all my life and i give 
millions and millions to charity he said 
prosecutors had asked spellman to give him jail time arguing it 
would be a deterrent to tax evasion 
but monsignor bryan walsh a member of the committee and head of 
the charity organization of the roman catholic archdiocese of 
miami said the sentence could be a great help to the homeless 
there is so little help for the homeless in south florida 
he said noting the city has no permanent public shelters for them 
posner was indicted in 1982 on charges of filing false returns 
between 1975 and 1979 and of evading taxes by inflating the value 
of property he donated to miami christian college 
miami real estate broker william scharrer sr was charged with 
aiding and abetting in the tax violations he was convicted in 1984 
and sentenced to 18 months 
posners holdings include controlling interests in royal crown 
cola sharon steel corp arbys and the graniteville textile 
company he was named americas highestpaid executive by business 
week magazine in 1985 
the secretive industrialist who rarely grants public interview 
reportedly earned 86 million in 1986 
posner a high school dropout and son of a russian immigrant 
has sold off holdings in recent years to pay company debts 
his evans products co and sharon steel have filed for 
reorganization under chapter 11 of us bankruptcy law

people who are able to laugh it up under 
pressure seem to have greater resistance to stressrelated ailments 
than those who dont according to a psychologist studying the link 
between humor and health 
this study points to the conclusion that humor does confer 
some health benefit when youre under stress albert porterfield 
assistant professor of psychology at oberlin college said friday 
porterfield based his observations on preliminary results of a 
study of 140 oberlin students who were tested to determine their 
sense of humor then completed questionnaires on incidence of such 
stressrelated maladies as headaches rashes and digestive 
problems 
there is a longrecognized relationship between the kinds of 
stress one encounters throughout life and depression and physical 
illness porterfield said what isnt wellunderstood are the 
factors that determine how strongly daytoday stress and 
wellbeing are linked in people 
for students whose sense of humor was ranked in the top 50 
percent there was no significant link between their stress levels 
and how they felt physically he said for those on the lower half 
of the humor scale there was a positive connection between stress 
and illness 
the results were similar when the same students were tested a 
year later porterfield said the connection between humor and 
resistance to stressrelated illnesses seems to show a marked 
increase for those above the 60th percentile in the humor rating 
he said 
the humor rankings were based on two tests one presents 
subjects with hypothetical situations and asks them how they would 
respond the other deals with subjects use of humor in times of 
stress

authorities today said they intercepted 
14 tons of topgrade heroin bound for new york worth more than 2 
billion on the street in what was believed to be the worlds 
largest single heroin bust 
the 2822 pounds of no 4 grade heroin were hidden in bales of 
rubber sheets on a freighter at klong toey port in bangkok said 
viroj laohaphan the director general of the customs department 
no 4 grade heroin is 97 percent pure 
viroj said the drug was discovered when customs officials 
acting on a tip began opening the 665 bales earlier this week 
heroin had been found in 62 bales by the time the search was 
completed friday night he told a news conference 
the ship was to leave for new york later this month authorities 
said 
the packing in rubber sheets prevented police dogs from 
smelling the heroin viroj said if this amount of heroin had 
left thailand it would have killed an uncountable number of 
people 
viroj said the previous largest heroin bust was of 2640 pounds 
seized in france in 1972 
ross petzing spokesman for the us embassy in bangkok said 
the biggest previous heroin seizure that us drug enforcement 
administration officials in thailand could recall was a haul also 
of 2640 pounds 
that seizure was made several years ago on a shrimp boat off the 
coast of a central american country petzing said he said he had 
no further details of that bust 
petzing said no 4 grade heroin cut diluted and sold on the 
streets of new york would fetch about 16 million a kilogram

it could be months before an ironworker 
learns whether he will regain the use of a hand torn off in an 
industrial accident and joined to his abdomen for 2 months to save 
it doctors say 
twelve doctors reattached mike thomas hand to his arm during 
22 hours of surgery that ended friday thomas 31 of cleveland 
ala was in serious condition in an intensive care unit at 
university hospital 
to our knowledge this is the first time a severed limb has 
been kept alive this way in the united states said hospital 
spokesman hank black 
even if the surgery turns out successful the nerve damage to 
the hand was such that thomas will never be able to do the type 
work he did before said one of the surgeons paul sauer 
hopefully we will have a hand which will at least have enough 
feeling to serve as a helper to mr thomas other hand and one 
that is cosmetically superior to a prosthesis he said 
he said that thomas would be required to keep his left arm and 
hand in a cradlelike position 
sauer and another surgeon michael miller said it might be 
months before miller learns whether he will be able to use his left 
hand at all if the reattachment doesnt work they said the hand 
might have to be amputated 
meanwhile he will go through intensive therapy 
we think that we can achieve adequate circulation to the hand 
and that the bone will grow together but how well the nerves and 
muscles will regenerate is the question sauer said 
using microscopes and sutures thinner than a human hair the 
surgeons reattached two of the three main nerves to the hand 
thomas lost the hand wrist and a small part of his forearm when 
he grabbed a cable to break a 70foot fall from a girder while he 
was working at a church nov 24 the cable wrapped around his 
forearm and pulled the hand off 
because the break was not clean doctors said they were not 
sure at first whether the nerves were damaged too badly to allow 
the implant 
to gain time to study the problem they decided to attach the 
hands arteries veins and skin to those on his abdomen 
such an attachment has been used twice once successfully in 
yugoslavia with a broken limb attached to blood vessels under an 
arm doctors said 
thomas is expected to return home within two weeks

taking valentines day seriously is the raison 
detre behind paris first salon de lamour where the lovelorn 
can seek counsel in trying to ignite revive or fan the flames of 
passion 
why is love always presented in such a fragmented way when 
love is indivisible asked fabienne baudot an organizer of the 
fourday exhibition the range of exhibitors here is 
intentionally vast to give visitors as much information as 
possible 
stands around the hall display sense enhancers such as lingerie 
and aphrodisiacs there are counselors on sex and health and a 
booth with information on aids 
its not because you love a car that you know how to drive 
it said dr jacques waynberg a leading paris sexologist who is 
among the specialists lecturing on love at the event that runs 
through valentines day 
the traditional box of chocolates has been replaced by a new 
valentines day wine produced in the rhone river town of 
roquemaure where the relics of st valentine are kept 
valentines day gets less fanfare in france than across the 
atlantic and experts say this first salon reflects a trend 
an exhibition founded on the word love wouldnt have been 
understood by the french public five years ago waynberg said in 
an interview then people were more sensitized to the sexual 
dimension of things 
an exhibit on eroticism is held in paris annually but in 
france as in other western countries the trend is toward the less 
ephemeral aspects of a relationship 
waynberg told a conference that sex is like a job to be 
learned and that sex and love do not necessarily mix 
erotic life obeys a certain competence it is a job you have 
to know how to make love he said otherwise its like giving 
a beautiful book to someone who doesnt know how to read 
waynberg emphasized the fragile foundations of many 
relationships so often based on passionate or sentimental love 
both volatile commodities 
its a sentiment that i question as a professional he said 
in poetry it is good in art it is perfect in itself it is 
highly questionable i dont say love is sad but i say its 
dangerous 
if there is no marriage de raison between a couple then you 
must have reason in a marriage of love 
the emphasis on passion and sex is falling off according to a 
recent cover story in the newsweekly vsd 
a 1972 study showed that 80 percent of french adults considered 
a successful sex life a determining source of happiness a poll 
taken in 1986 showed that only 39 percent of french people 
considered sex a determining factor in their happiness 
a poll earlier this month indicated that one french woman in 
three and one french man in four is sometimes or often 
bored during lovemaking 
todays young generation is moving away from the joys of eros 
waynberg said the young women are taking a fresh look at their 
grandmothers mistresses of hearth and home and reassessing their 
options 
grandmother was maybe not such a bimbo after all waynberg 
said 
as the session closed a portly elderly man shook his head in 
agreement sex and love are two separate things he said then 
turning to his neighbor he recalled his late wife who died eight 
years ago 
during her illness she told him to pay a visit to another woman 
another woman the man repeated with a hint of amazement and 
admiration and as though the incident were yesterday now thats 
love isnt it thats love

a fivealarm fire today consumed the landmark 
high school that inspired the hit movie and tv show fame 
injuring 30 of the 200 firefighters battling the blaze in freezing 
temperatures and high winds 
the third fourth and fifth floors and a section of the roof of 
the sixstory former high school for the performing arts in 
manhattan collapsed forcing officials to pull all firefighters out 
of the building said spokesman efrain parrilla 
some firefighters were sent back into the building about two 
hours later because there was no other way to get to the blaze 
parilla said 
the fire was declared under control by 530 am nearly five 
hours after it was reported parrilla said pockets of flame were 
expected to continue burning through the morning but firefighters 
were expected to be able to keep it from spreading 
four firefighters were sent to hospitals with minor injuries 
parrilla said twentysix others were treated at the scene for 
sprain cuts and other minor injuries 
the fire at what is now liberty high school near times square 
was reported at 1238 am the blaze started on the third floor and 
burned up to the roof parrilla said 
high winds and slippery conditions due to recent snow and rain 
hampered firefighters the spokesman said the national weather 
service reported winds gusting to 28 mph and wind chills of minus 7 
the high school was designated a city landmark in 1982 the 
performing arts school part of the public school system combined 
with the high school of music and art about three years ago and 
moved to a new home 
although the board of education did not permit film crews to 
shoot scenes for fame inside the high school building the 
facade was seen in the 1980 film and the tv series

two us warships violated soviet territorial 
waters ignored warnings from patrol craft and made dangerous 
maneuvers that led to collisions with soviet ships in the black 
sea a soviet admiral charged today 
rear adm nikolai p markov appeared at a hastily called news 
briefing to give the first detailed kremlin version of the incident 
that happened off the crimean peninsula in which two soviet navy 
vessels grazed the american warships 
on friday night the defense ministry accused the american 
vessels of violating soviet waters but did not mention any 
physical contact between them and soviet ships 
us navy officials said the cruiser uss yorktown and the 
destroyer uss caron were deliberately bumped while exercising their 
right to pass through international waters 
however markov and foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov told reporters the us warships were knowingly violating 
soviet waters and said the collisions were the fault of the 
american captains 
unlike the united states which claims a threemile territorial 
limit the soviet union claims a 12mile limit along its coast 
gerasimov said us ambassador jack matlock had been summoned to 
the foreign ministry today where deputy foreign minister alexander 
bessmertnykh read him a strong protest 
the soviet side cannot but view the actions of the united 
states navy as aimed at undermining the process of improvement in 
sovietamerican relations which has appeared recently gerasimov 
said quoting from the protest 
us navy cmdr richard schiff a lawyer said friday in 
washington that any country claiming a 12mile territorial limit 
must allow for innocent passage by the ships of all nations 
but markov and gerasimov said soviet law does not provide for 
the right of innocent passage in black sea waters which the 
soviets have longed claimed as their own 
markov was repeatedly asked to specify what he meant by 
dangerous maneuvers and said the american warships had been 
warned both before and after entering soviet waters 
generally one can and should regard the very fact of entering 
soviet territorial waters as dangerous maneuvering he said 
he said the two soviet warships identified by pentagon 
officials as a krivakclass frigate and a mirkaclass patrol boat 
were on a basically parallel course with the us vessels when 
the grazings occurred 
the larger krivakclass vessel brushed the left side of the 
yorktown while the caron was grazed on the same side by the patrol 
craft us officials said 
both us and soviet officials have said the grazings caused no 
injuries 
markov did not name the soviet warships but a small chart 
displayed at the briefing identified them as the frigate bezzavetny 
and the patrol ship skr6 
according to the chart the american warships steaming 
eastward entered soviet waters at about 11 am moscow time south 
of sevastopol headquarters of the soviet black sea fleet 
markov said at one time the two american ships were as close as 
92 miles to shore he said they remained in soviet territorial 
waters following the grazings 
the yorktown left soviet waters at 1221 pm moscow time south 
of the resort city of yalta and the caron sailing north of the 
cruiser followed about a halfhour later according to the chart 
at last notice the two us vessels were back to routine 
operations in the black sea navy capt gerry flynn said friday 
in washington 
markov said the friday incident was the third of its kind in 
recent years 
in march 1986 the same two ships the yorktown and the caron 
violated soviet territorial waters in the black sea he said and 
two american warships penetrated soviet waters off kamchatka in the 
soviet far east last year 
in washington a highranking state department official 
speaking on condition of anonymity said that although the 
department had protested the soviets behavior he did not expect 
the incident to disturb a ussoviet effort to narrow differences 
on arms control human rights regional disputes and bilateral 
issues 
secretary of state george p shultz is scheduled to go to moscow 
in two weeks to further those efforts and talk about a ussoviet 
summit meeting tentatively scheduled in the soviet capital in the 
spring

researchers in japan switzerland and the united 
states are experimenting with a new class of ceramics which may 
carry larger electric currents than other superconductors a swiss 
scientist reported 
karl alex muller a 1987 nobel laureate in physics told a 
breakfast meeting at boston university on friday the new ceramic 
compounds were discovered in japan in january 
he said they were duplicated and improved by researchers in his 
zurich laboratory 
meanwhile du pont co scientists friday said they had been able 
to duplicate the japanese results and had also identified the 
structure and composition of the ceramics 
muller is scheduled to address the american association for the 
advancement of science which is holding its annual meeting here 
on monday 
i am very glad im delighted that we have found these new 
compounds said muller who received an honorary doctorate from 
the university thursday with these temperatures you can be much 
more optimistic about achieving high currents 
the new ceramics may overcome a problem with other materials 
which bar the running of large currents through hightemperature 
superconductors researchers said 
superconductors are materials which allow transmission of 
electricity with no resistance or loss of energy materials which 
can carry high electric currents and generate large magnetic fields 
might lead to very fast computers andlong distance transmission of 
electricity 
a team of scientists at the national institute for metals in 
tsukuba japan was the first to find superconductivity in the new 
ceramics working at 243 degrees below zero 
the material is made up bismuth strontium calcium and copper 
mixed with oxygen 
muller indicated that his team working for the international 
business machines corp also had been able to identify the 
materials structure 
he said his group had achieved superconductivity at higher 
temperatures than the japanese but declined to provide details 
researchers are writing a report on the results said ibm 
spokesman gerald present 
researchers in superconductivity have sought to find a stable 
reproducible material that works at temperatures above 288 degrees 
below zero superconductivity becomes stronger as temperature drops

two hundred years after a group of men gathered 
to write the constitution women and minorities are closing in on 
equal status but still have many hurdles to cross coretta scott 
king told a national symposium 
mrs king wife of slain civil rights leader martin luther king 
jr said friday that criticism of the constitution as it was 
adopted in 1787 is justified 
her speech came in the closing day of a symposium on women and 
the constitution convened by former first ladies rosalynn carter 
and lady bird johnson about 1500 women from all 50 states and 10 
foreign countries attended 
some people apparently feel that blacks and women should join 
in an uncritical celebration of a document that protected the slave 
trade and denied women their democratic rights mrs king said 
we still have a way to go before we can say that the constitution 
is working for all americans 
mrs king echoed another speaker at the symposium 1984 vice 
presidential candidate geraldine ferraro in calling for more 
political activism on the part of women 
if america is to fulfill the promise of the constitution we 
will need many more women of all races holding elective office 
mrs king said we have a strength and tenacity and a gift for 
nurturing and compassion which has been finely honed and tempered 
in our struggle to raise families in a sexist society 
we just might save this nation from its pending apointment 
with armageddon she said 
mrs king said the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s 
laid the groundwork for the womens rights movements of the years 
that followed she said the kind of organized nonviolent dissent 
championed by her late husband is still an effective form of 
protest 
the civil rights movement showed millions of americans that 
you can indeed you must defy authority when that authority is in 
the wrong mrs king said 
earlier friday ms ferraro said that while no women are among 
the candidates for president in either party women have reached 
higher levels in the campaign organizations than ever before 
the women who hold positions of responsibility in presidential 
campaigns whether or not their candidate is ultimately successful 
will forge contacts and gain credibility that will endure beyond 
this election cycle she said 
many of them will be back with higher ambitions and sharper 
skills in 1992 ms ferraro said 
ms ferraro whose presence on the 1984 democratic ticket with 
walter mondale was a high point for the womens movement said the 
women in some of the 1988 campaigns will go on to be advisers to 
the next president 
and thats important too she said the current 
administration has widely been regarded as hostile to womens 
issues that is in part because this presidents inner circle of 
advisers have except for his wife been men

carnival when practically the 
whole of brazil puts its worries aside and parties roundtheclock 
for four straight days struts and sways to a start today 
the festival ends on ash wednesday feb 17 when brazilians can 
begin pondering again the nations huge foreign debt and corruption 
scandals in the suitable bleakness of lent 
for now however party is the word 
carnival is an escape valve said roberto couri president 
of rios monte libano club a main center of celebration it 
doesnt matter what troubles there may be when carnival comes 
brazilians plunge right in 
carnival seems to have been made for brazilians and they began 
working up to it well in advance so many people had their minds on 
carnival this week that it was difficult to transact business with 
either private companies or the government 
not even a strike that began friday by the nations two largest 
airlines varig and vasp would stop the party flight crews walked 
off the job and said they would strike until sunday tying up most 
domestic and some international flights 
in brasilia the normally sedate inland capital a prefestival 
highlight was a barathon 
contestants ran about 3 miles and the winner was the person 
who swilled the most beer from an accompanying tank truck not the 
one who finished first 
in rio the hub of carnival noisy block parties punctured the 
week and the first balls were held in a series that continues 
through the celebration 
the dances which attract thousands of revelers and last all 
night range from the sophisticated champagne ball to the earthy 
bumbum ball 
one of the most popular events is rios samba school parade 
scheduled for sunday and monday nights in the sambadrome six 
blocks of openair concrete bleachers near downtown 
competing will be the citys 16 best samba schools which serve 
as neighborhood social clubs 
each school puts 40006000 brilliantly costumed people on the 
route in a spectacle that lasts for about 16 hours each day 
most participants dressed as kings princesses amazon 
chieftains greek gods and maharajas toil the rest of the year at 
nondescript jobs that often pay the minimum wage of 60 a month 
when it began the samba school parade was an informal folk 
event now it is big business 
this year the samba school league formed in 1985 to protect the 
clubs interests sold exclusive television rights for the parades 
for a reported 1 million to the commercial network tv globo 
samba parade tickets for foreign tourists were jacked up this 
year to as much as 238 each payable in us dollars 
many local travel agents refused to distribute them at such 
prices 
the president of the samba school league a burly man known only 
as captain guimaraes said on television in the past samba 
schools were exploited yet they were the ones who created the 
entire show yes were after more money to protect the

guerrillas attacked a white 
farmers house with rocket launchers and firearms early today then 
fled across the border into zimbabwe the government said 
no one was injured in the predawn attack and damage to the 
farmhouse was minor said the regional army commander gen george 
meiring he said a limpet mine and antipersonnel mines were found 
in the area 
south african officials said the attackers had entered from 
zimbabwe and sent a terse message to the government of the 
neighboring blackruled state 
the south african government urges the zimbabwean government 
immediately to seek out the attackers and also wishes to state that 
it reserves the right to take whatever steps it deems necessary to 
prevent further incursions of this nature the message said 
in the past south african forces have staged raids into 
neighboring countries on suspected bases of the african national 
congress black guerrilla movement 
zimbabwe like several other countries bordering south africa 
says it allows the anc to operate politically but not militarily in 
its territory 
over the past three years anc guerrillas occasionally have 
placed land mines on the roads of whiteowned farms in south 
african border areas 
about 20 whites and blacks have been killed in the attacks 
which the anc says are justified because most white farmers 
participate in an antiguerrilla civil defense network 
during the land mine campaign there have been few assaults on 
farmhouses 
the anc is the main guerrilla group fighting to end 
whiteminority domination in south africa 
south africas 5 million whites control the government and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services under a 
legal and traditional system of racial segregation called 
apartheid the countrys 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs 
in a separate incident police said two black municipal 
policemen were shot and seriously wounded friday night by unknown 
assailants in soweto johannesburgs main black township 
black officers have been frequent targets of anc guerrillas and 
antiapartheid militants who consider them government collaborators

authorities said three suspects were in 
custody today in connection with an aborted attempt to assassinate 
president amin gemayel by planting a bomb in a plane he was to take 
to north yemen and sudan 
a police spokesman said the three were being held in solitary 
confinement pending completion of investigation 
the spokesman who cannot be identified in line with 
regulations refused to give the suspects names he only said they 
were all lebanese airport employees 
a onepound charge of tnt was planted under the pilots seat of 
the middle east airlines boeing 707 that had been scheduled to 
leave for larnaca cyprus friday and later fly gemayel to north 
yemen 
the bomb was found and defused by explosives experts at beirut 
airport 
gemayel 44 left on another middle east arlines boeing 707 
today 
the president usually travels by military helicopter from the 
christian heartland northeast of beirut to larnaca and flies from 
there to world capitals 
gemayel a maronite catholic has not used the beirut airport in 
the citys western moslem sector since 1984 when moslem and 
leftist militias wrested control of the sector from the lebanese 
army 
the airport is now currently controlled by syrian troops who 
deployed in the western sector nearly a year ago in an effort to 
end three years of militia anarchy 
the police spokesman said the explosive charge was equipped with 
a sophisticated pressure fuse that would have detonated it when 
the plane reaches an altitude of 30000 feet 
this means that the bomb was designed to explode during the 
presidential flight from larnaca to sana when the plane usually 
flies at 30000 feet and more the spokesman said 
planes during the 20minute trip from beirut to larnaca 
usually do not fly at an altitude of more than 10000 feet he 
said 
lebanon has been plagued by assassinations car bombings and 
kidnappings since its moslemchristian civil war broke out in 1975 
the conflict has claimed more than 130000 lives 
moslem prime minister rashid karami was killed june 1 by a bomb 
planted in a lebanese army helicopter that was flying him from 
north lebanon to beirut 
moslem leaders blamed the assassination on the lebanese forces 
a rightwing christian militia alliance and accused gemayel of 
covering up for them 
gemayels brother bashir who led the lebanese forces was 
killed sept 14 1982 in a bomb explosion at a political gathering a 
week before he was to take office as elected president of lebanon 
amin gemayel was later elected president

an iraqi jet bomber fired a cruise 
missile within eight miles of the uss chandler in the persian gulf 
after the american destroyer warned the warplane away with flares 
the warships captain said 
the chandler which went to full alert was escorting four 
usflagged kuwaiti tankers and neither it nor the merchant ships 
were hit no injuries were reported 
the chandler and the tankers were not the apparent targets 
the incident occurred friday night and was reported today by the 
pentagons persian gulf media pool 
pool reporters said the incident occurred at about 9 pm and 
that the iraqi badger bomber was on a trajectory toward the iranian 
oil terminal of sirri island the iraqis reported hitting a very 
large maritime target or supertanker at sirri island at about 
the same time 
reporters could not determine whether any targets were actually 
struck at sirri 
iraqi planes occasionally have mistakenly hit fishing trawlers 
and other neutral vessels 
last may an iraqi jet fired a missile into the frigate uss 
stark killing 37 american sailors iraq said the pilot mistook the 
stark for an iranian warship and washington accepted its apology 
determining that the sovietmade badger was too close for 
comfort the chandler fired two flares from its 5inch guns said 
the pool report filed through washington by norman kempster of the 
los angeles times 
cmdr steve smith captain of the chandler said he was 
concerned because iraqi pilots often fire at radar blips without 
making sure what their targets are 
having watched the geometry of their attacks for some time i 
was concerned that he would be firing his missile while he was 
heading toward us smith said over the ships public address 
system after the incident 
he told pool reporters that the iraqi pilot fired two c601 
missiles a 50milerange airlaunched version of the styx which 
china copied in producing its betterknown silkworms 
smith said both missiles passed astern of the chandler the last 
ship in the convoy but one suddenly changed course and passed 
along the starboard side of the ship before veering away seconds 
later it detonated producing a bright flash 
cruise missiles can have several guidance systems ranging from 
radio to infrared control 
in a report monitored in cyprus the official iraqi news agency 
said iraqi warplanes struck their target at 908 pm friday it 
gave no other details smith said friday nights incident was the 
closest approach of a missile to the chandler which has been in 
the gulf since nov 25 us warships have been escorting reflagged 
kuwaiti tankers through the gulf since july to protect them from 
attacks by iran which accuses kuwait of helping iraq in the 
7yearold iraniraq war 
smith placed his crew on general quarters the highest state 
of alert after the badger which had earlier passed the convoy on 
a flight south along the gulf from iraq turned back north and 
headed straight for the ship 
smith said he was prepared to try to shoot down the missile if 
it appeared to be on a course that would strike any ship in the 
convoy he said he readied the standard1 antiaircraft missile 
shoulderfired stinger missiles and the automaticfiring phalanx 
gattling gun 
smith said he informed the badger by radio that it was 
approaching a us convoy and ordered it to turn back he said the 
iraqi pilot who did not speak english very well did not seem to 
understand 
smith said he then warned the iraqi jet that he planned to fire 
two illumination rounds as soon as the flares went off smith 
said the iraqi jet turned sharply away from the ship and fired the 
c601s 
iraqi warplanes usually fire radarguided missiles at iranian 
naval targets and iraq later announces the hits the planes are 
equipped mainly with heatseeking waterskimming exocet missiles 
supplied by france 
shipping executives said today that a danish supertanker struck 
late thursday in an attack initially blamed on iran now appears to 
have been hit by iraqi warplanes 
the executives had said friday that the 339000ton kate maersk 
laden with saudi oil was hit by an iranian helicopter a danish 
seaman was killed and three others were injured 
salvage tugs that rushed to the aid of the kate maersk said 
there was a gaping hole above the ships waterline indicating it 
had been hit by an exocet 
iraq has been attacking iranian tankers and oil facilities to 
cut off its oil revenues which finance its war the two have been 
fighting since september 1980 
iran retaliates by attacking neutral merchant shipping mainly 
vessels involved in commerce with kuwait and saudi arabia which 
tehran accuses of supporting iraq

president reagan said today he and mexicos 
president miguel de la madrid would act to strengthen the 
commercial ties between our peoples as they held their sixth 
summit meeting in six years 
in his weekly radio address prerecorded in washington and 
released here before the presidents departure for todays meeting 
in mazatlan mexico reagan said commercial ties between the two 
countries are of great benefit to people on both sides of the 
border 
weve worked hard to make it that way he said last 
november we signed a new framework of understanding that 
underscored our special trade and investment relationship 
during our meetings in mazatlan president de la madrid and i 
will reaffirm our commitment to take advantage of every opportunity 
to strengthen the commercial ties between our peoples 
the united states is mexicos largest trading partner mexico is 
the fourth largest trading partner of the united states behind 
canada japan and west germany 
although putting the emphasis on trade reagan also touched in 
his radio address on two subjects the war on drugs and guerrilla 
warfare in central america over which the two countries have 
sharp differences 
the traffickers would go out of business if people quit buying 
illegal drugs the president said thats the real solution 
and its up to each and every one of us to be part of the 
solution 
us officials have said that mexico does not do enough to 
combat the drug trade and mexican officials in turn have argued 
that the united state should act more aggressively to curb demand 
turning to central america the president said that the 
establishment of totalitarian regimes supported by cuba and the 
soviet union is a threat to stability and freedom in the region 
i would hope that the united states and mexico will find common 
interest in opposing any such totalitarian threat he said 
mexico has opposed the us policy of aiding rebels fighting the 
marxistled government of nicaragua 
reagan also said that the united states will continue to do 
our best to help find solutions to the vexing problems of mexicos 
international debt 
mexico owes approximately 80 billion to commercial banks and 
the treasury department announced in december it would be selling 
the mexican government up to 10 billion in special us bonds to 
be used as collateral to help pay off the debt 
reagan said friday he and de la madrid would sign a new 
fouryear textile accord during their meeting at the mexican port 
the washingtonbased council on hemispheric affairs in an 
analysis released in advance of todays meeting said it would be 
difficult for the two countries to achieve an agreement similar to 
the one negotiated last year between the united states and canada 
the reason it said is that the mexicanus border marks the 
only such line in the western world where a remarkably rich market 
confronts a remarkably poor one 
reagan long an advocate of a north american common market on 
jan 2 signed a uscanadian agreement negotiated last year that 
would eliminate all tariffs and most other trade barriers between 
the two countries by 1999 
mexico and the united states have however worked out trade 
agreements dealing with steel textiles shoes and beer

firm and working 
we will not make concessions to terrorists or compromise our 
fundamental principles schultz said behavior rewarded is 
behavior repeated terrorism must not pay

in the face of terrorism since then much has happened but i 
believe that we have all emerged from our experiences with a firm 
set of convictions about terrorism 
the 30minute speech was interrupted by applause seven times 
including when shultz said israel has provided a great example in 
dealing with terrorism 
courage skill and public support are the watchwords of the 
israeli effort against terrorism shultz said when the story 
is written of how the democracies beat the terrorists let our 
names appear together 
shultz divided administration policy on combating terrorism into 
four categories intelligencegathering understanding terrorists 
aims and strategies security measures to protect americans and 
offensive efforts to disrupt terrorist operations 
he said intelligence efforts have averted more than 200 
terrorist attacks in the past three years and people are alive 
and well today who never even suspected they were in danger

representatives of 150 black students 
occupying a building at the university of massachusetts refused to 
meet with the chancellor today saying they would sit in the 
building until their demands are met 
it has become obvious to us that you are not being 
reasonable said sophomore mark codlingdave a spokesman for the 
students who took over the new africa house on friday 
as far as we are concerned we have nothing else to say he 
added 
the students demands included prosecution of white students who 
allegedly beat two black students and a white woman last weekend 
suspension of white campus police accused of forcing blacks into a 
lineup and removal of classrooms to return new africa house to its 
former use as a cultural center for the black community 
chancellor joseph duffey said after the students refused to meet 
with him that he planned to go home and wait for the protesters to 
call him obviously we have to talk he said 
university spokeswoman jeanne hopkinsstover said earlier that 
the protesters had agreed to meet with the chancellor today 
duffey said he regretted the lineup by the campus officers and 
had ordered them not to do it again he said however that 
prosecution of the alleged assailants was a matter for the courts 
he also said there was too little space on campus to move 
classrooms out of the new africa house my first responsibility 
here is education and this building is committed to education in a 
range of ways im not about to put black afroamerican professors 
out of this building 
duffey said he planned no reprisals against the protesters 
theyre not disrupting anything and i dont think they intend 
to he added 
dwayne warren a student serving as liaison between duffey and 
the protesters estimated that up to 150 students spent the night 
in the building 
blacks at the 25000student university say an undercurrent of 
racism has not abated since oct 27 1986 when blacks and whites 
clashed following the boston red sox loss to the new york mets in 
the final game of the world series 
two black students and the white girlfriend of one of the men 
filed complaints earlier this week against six white men alleging 
civil rights violations and assault and battery stemming from an 
attack last weekend 
the chancellor issued a statement condemning the alleged attack 
after a delegation of black students presented their demands friday 
the demands included the expulsion of the accused whites and 
the suspension of white campus police officers who apparently 
ordered a lineup of seven black men at a dorm early feb 6 after a 
white student complained of being harassed by a black man 
duffeys statement said two of the students allegedly involved 
in the beatings have been ordered to move out of the schools 
residence halls all five face disciplinary hearings within the 
next two weeks 
it should be clear once again that the university will not 
tolerate physical abuse or racially associated attacks on others 
his statement said saying he started it or she started it is 
not an excuse 
a court hearing is scheduled feb 24 to determine whether there 
is enough evidence to charge the men accused of the weekend 
beatings 
the chancellor issued a separate report to the head of campus 
police asking him to cease lineups in the future 
the activity was most inappropriate especially in this 
particular instance because only minority students were required to 
line up for possible identification the report said 
one of the three men in the lineup was arrested on an 
outstanding warrant and two others were banned from campus for 
trespassing ms hopkinsstover said 
about 7 percent of the students at the school are black

sen joseph r biden jr was alert and talking 
with family members today after undergoing surgery at walter reed 
army medical center to correct an aneurysm in an artery supplying 
blood to his brain 
the 45yearold deleware democrat was progressing 
satisfactorily this morning and was as comfortable as 
possible hospital spokesman pete esker said 
biden underwent a surgical procedure known as a clipping to 
correct the aneurysm which is a sac formed by local enlargement of 
the weakened wall of an artery 
esker said bidens aneurysm was within his cranium underneath 
the brain but not inside the brain itself 
pete smith an aide to biden said biden was listed in 
seriously ill condition but was expected to suffer no 
significant aftereffects from the surgery 
the surgery did not involve the removal of any brain tissue 
and there is every indication that the senator will recover 
satisfactorily smith said he is awake alert oriented and 
moving all extremities well the length of his hospital stay will 
depend on his continued progress 
clipping is a microsurgical technique in which a minute 
metal clip is slipped around the aneurysm parallel to the artery 
the aneurysm is then deflated and the artery heals the clip is 
left in place 
smith said the surgery was performed in friday afternoon but 
there was no immediate information on when it began or how long it 
took 
i am told that he is in intensive care which walter reed said 
is normal for surgical patients and his family is with him at the 
hospital smith said biden and his wife jill have three 
children 
biden was admitted to the hospital early friday after being 
transferred from st francis hospital in wilmington del where 
the senator lives 
biden a threeterm senator had been complaining for a couple 
of weeks about what had been diagnosed as a pinched nerve in his 
neck 
he wore a neck brace two weeks ago during hearings on the 
proposed intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty with the soviet 
union he was ill and unable to vote last week on the confirmation 
of anthony kennedy to the supreme court biden as chairman of the 
senate judiciary commitee had led the committee hearings on 
kennedys nomination to the top court 
this week biden felt well enough to appear for several speaking 
engagements at colleges on the east coast 
the senator last june announced he was a candidate for the 
presidency but withdrew from the race in september in the wake of 
disclosures that he committed plagiarism during law school and 
exaggerated his academic accomplishments during campaign stops

supporters call him in english the man 
a takeoff on his initials critics call him in spanish cara de 
pina or pineapple face because of his pocked and jowly 
visage 
the united states calls him a fugitive from justice a man who 
put himself and his country up for sale to drug traffickers and 
made millions of dollars in the process 
but few would deny that gen manuel antonio noriega is a shrewd 
wily and tough politician who will not easily be dislodged as the 
de facto ruler of panama 
he is sly enough suggest several us senators to have conned 
the united states government into supporting him for years despite 
longstanding rumors of his involvement in drug smuggling election 
fraud and other corruption 
washington began to distance itself from noriega only after the 
headless body of one of his leading opponents hugo spadafora 
turned up in a us mailbag in costa rica in late 1985 several 
former associates say noriega ordered the slaying after spadafora 
publicly accused him of drug trafficking 
indictments returned by federal grand juries in miami and tampa 
fla on feb 5 accuse noriega of using his position as the 
commander of panamas defense forces to allow colombian drug 
traffickers to use his country as a base for smuggling cocaine and 
marijuana into the united states 
noriega the indictments say got a healthy kickback from the 
narcotics profits they put his take at up to 48 million 
by any account noriega has done well for someone born into 
poverty in a relatively poor country and raised by foster parents 
from the age of 5 
details of noriegas early life are scarce and even his birthday 
is in dispute his official biography lists his age as 50 but high 
school records put it at 54 
after attending a military college in peru on a scholarship 
noriega entered the panamanian national guard in 1962 as a 
lieutenant he quickly became acquainted with a rising young 
officer named omar torrijos 
torrijos took power in panama in a 1968 coup and less than a 
year later named noriega then an obscure major in charge of the 
countrys northernmost province as his chief of intelligence with 
the rank of lieutenant colonel 
in his new position noriega began collecting dossiers on 
everyone who counted in panama friends and enemies alike he also 
had jurisdiction over the countrys customs and immigration 
departments long a source of funds for the military 
the job also put noriega in touch with us intelligence 
agencies interested in any potential threats to the security of the 
panama canal a vital shipping link between the atlantic and 
pacific oceans 
when torrijos died in an unexplained airplane crash in 1981 
noriega was well placed to shoulder his way to the top command 
ahead of several more senior officers it took him two years 
in addition to drug smuggling noriega is reputed to have his 
finger in a wide variety of other enterprises some legal and 
others operating on the fringes of the law they are said to 
include duty free liquor stores maritime services banks gambling 
casinos newspapers a television station and 12 radio stations 
although his official salary is 60000 a year noriega lives in 
a twostory colonialstyle mansion in one of panama citys most 
exclusive neighborhoods maintains a fleet of expensive cars and is 
reported to own at least a dozen other properties including an 
apartment in paris and a chateau in the south of france

children who become entangled in selfstyled satanism often 
share an obsession with heavy metal rock music but its exact 
influence on them is hotly debated 
police and parents groups agree that more than 95 percent of 
the teenagers who listen to heavy metal simply enjoy it and never 
act out a few become more deeply involved 
you might say heavy metal rock music is to selfstyled 
satanism what gospel music is to christianity said carl rashcke 
director of the university of denver institute of humanities 
very few people get converted to christianity just by listening 
to gospel music on the radio but heavy metal is a very powerful 
reinforcement it legitimizes the nasty stuff the kids are already 
into 
an attorney for one of three missouri youths charged in the 
beating death of a fourth said they were deeply involved with the 
music one favorite of the client ronald charles clements was 
black friday by megadeth whose lyrics clements had memorized 
the lyrics in part 
my hammers a cold piece of blood lethal steel 
i grin while you writhe with the pain that i deal 
their bodies convulse in agony and pain 
i mangle their faces til no features remain 
i told him that this music just made me want to puke 
attorney cr rhoades said i asked him to explain to me why he 
enjoys it and he said its just the energy you feel it gives me 
a rush 
that rush can be a physiological reality said denver police 
detective cleo wilson 
its used as a hype and it can become addictive because of 
the adrenalin flow it causes in your body she said it causes 
the heart rate to go with the beat of the music so you get a type 
of high 
some kids spend up to six hours a day listening to such music 
you add the words of some of the songs to that it becomes a 
way of life for them because they believe it 
at least two lawsuits neither successful so far have been 
brought by parents who blame heavy metals influence for their 
childrens suicides while sometimes violent the lyrics of the 
musicians involved the group judas priest and singer ozzy 
osbourne can seem tame compared with songs by socalled black 
metal groups such as venom and slayer 
from venoms song possessed 
look at me satans child 
born of evil thus defiled 
brought to life through satanic birth 
listen to me and ill tell you 
things that will sicken your mind 
i drink the vomit of the priests 
make love with the dying whore 
satan as my master incarnate 
hail praise to my unholy host 
groups that sing about violence and devil worship cite their 
right to free expression the parents music resource center based 
in arlington va agrees that most satanism in music is a gimmick 
and the target of groundless hysteria 
but heavy metal violence including songs about necrophilia 
incest rape torture and human sacrifice is something parents 
should be aware of the group says 
when the concerned mother of a 14yearold recently phoned the 
pmrc executive director jennifer norwood suggested she listen to 
the music with her child and discuss it calmly 
i tell parents not to take the materials away we emphasize 
the need to communicate with their children she said children 
need to be taught how to think critically about the messages they 
get from the media then theyll reject these things themselves

convicted mercy killer roswell 
gilbert has asked for a new trial saying his lawyer botched the 
case by worrying too much about selling book and movie rights to 
the story 
gilberts current attorney bradley stark filed a 65page 
motion friday which included a sworn statment from attorney joseph 
varon acknowledging he may have erred in handling the case 
it is quite possible that the economic factor of the book and 
possible movie or television rights was prominent in my thinking 
and perhaps swayed my judgment in some critical areas varon said 
in the statement 
gilbert now 78 was convicted of firstdegree murder in may 
1985 two months after he fired two shots into the head of his wife 
of 51 years at their seaside condominium 
the retired electronics engineer said he killed his wife emily 
to end the misery she suffered from osteoporosis and alzheimers 
disease the case made national headlines and was made into a 
television movie that aired last year 
varon received 50000 for the sale of gilberts television 
movie rights gilbert got 5000 of that amount which he donated 
to charity 
in an attempt to capitalize on widespread publicity and sympathy 
for gilbert varon rushed to trial without hiring an investigator 
or interviewing witnesses in the case stark said 
in his statement varon said he put unrealistically great 
hopes on what he termed gilberts caretaker defense 
basically the defense was that gilbert should be pardoned because 
of the stress he experienced caring for a wife with alzheimers 
disease 
stark argued that varon gambled on the caretaker defense to the 
exclusion of other strategies because that gave the story the best 
chance of being bought by a movie producer 
he also said that varon made no effort to pleabargain on his 
clients behalf because that would have scuttled any movie or book 
depiction 
by relying on the sale of gilberts story for his fee varon was 
put in a conflict in which he had to choose between doing what was 
best for his client or creating what was most likely to be a 
marketable story stark contended 
varon was vacationing outside the country and could not be 
reached for comment by the associated press

obituaries want ads grocery ads 
and all the other news thats fit to print but usually not fit to 
broadcast are the daily staple of one unusual radio service 
the radio reading service of western massachusetts exists solely 
to relay nearly every word in area newspapers to those who cant 
read it said its founder and president katharine surette 
the service fills a need that even wellmeaning friends and 
relatives cant said ms surette who is blind 
when my fiance reads to me on sundays he reads 
discriminately what he wants to read she said unless i push 
real hard i dont get all the stories 
at the radio service we dont editorialize we try to read 
everything she said 
the 200 volunteer staff members read entire articles of local 
interest supermarket ads daily lottery payoffs and other 
important tidbits that regular news broadcasts usually skip 
obituaries are very important to listeners said ms 
surette if a friend passes away sometimes they have no other 
way of knowing that then they also like the lottery numbers they 
always call when we forget to read the payoffs 
volunteer edith favorato 73 said she has been going to the 
studio from her east longmeadow home every monday for the past 
three years to read magazine articles and books that are not 
available in recorded form 
i dont know any visually handicapped people but i think i 
can identify with them she said i feel im doing my little 
bit to bring some happiness to people who might not otherwise have 
it 
a speech by stanley potter who began a reading service in 
minnesota in 1969 inspired ms surette to start her own service 
she said after years of pestering springfield technical community 
college for space and equipment she opened the service on the 
campus on jan 17 1983 
the service had 20 volunteers at the time twice the number of 
listeners 
anybody who could breathe and speak at the same time was on 
the air she said we dont have to do that anymore we have 
enough volunteers that we can do good training 
the service has since set up an office off campus with a live 
studio two recording booths and eight employees another studio 
in dalton provides news from the states westernmost counties 
it is financed largely by state agencies but does conduct 
fundraising campaigns and also receives some donations 
the program can be heard only through special receivers tuned to 
cable television or radio stations ms surette said there are 500 
receivers in homes nursing homes and hospitals throughout western 
massachusetts 
many of the receivers are donated by local charities loaned to 
listeners by the station or sold at cost about 90 the only 
thing we ask of listeners is that they be in some way print 
handicapped even if that means they cant hold a paper and turn 
the pages ms surette said 
each morning in west springfield begins with a twohour reading 
of the unionnews of springfield for those in and around the 
states thirdlargest city volunteers in dalton read the berkshire 
eagle and other berkshire county newspapers the readings are 
repeated every night 
newsmagazine and weekly newspaper readings are interspersed 
through the week book readings begin at noon and again at 11 pm 
usually the less colorful i shouldnt say less colorful maybe 
less offensive books are read during the day said program

when the fbi infiltrated a group of opponents 
of president reagans central america policies it suspected they 
were behind the stillunsolved november 1983 bombing of the us 
capitol 
secret fbi files made available under the freedom of information 
act show that for up to five years the bureau looked for links 
between the committee in solidarity with the people of el salvador 
and a number of terrorist acts it found none 
cispes contends the investigation was really based on its 
opposition to administration policies in el salvador and elsewhere 
in central america the fbi denies it 
fbi files also reveal the bureau was investigating whether 
cipses was considering any violent activities at the 1984 olympics 
in los angeles or the 1984 political conventions or whether it had 
any connection with the may 1983 bombing at the army national war 
college in washington 
one document said some of those interviewed in the investigation 
were told the fbi was checking into bombings of federal buildings 
and facilities of defense contractors 
the documents were among some 2000 pages of fbi records on 
investigation of the el salvador group released under the freedom 
of information act large portions of the requested documents were 
either blacked out by government censors or withheld entirely 
references to the bombings were the only indications of what the 
fbi was seeking in its investigations 
the suit was filed on behalf of cispes by the new york 
citybased center for constitutional rights 
beth perry cispes spokeswoman called the allegations that the 
group had a connection to the us capitol bombing or the bombing 
at the war college absolutely ridiculous 
she said some literature on the capitol bombing was passed out 
at a cispessponsored demonstration on nov 12 five days after the 
bombing but that the group had nothing to do with distributing 
that material 
asked about any plans for violence at the 1984 conventions or 
olympics she said the fbi called the national office of cispes to 
ask what the group planned 
cispes referred the fbi agent to its lawyer who told the agent 
that local groups might be planning peaceful demonstrations but no 
national effort was planned 
one of the fbi documents said the dallas field office received 
copies of literature produced by cispes at a demonstration on nov 
12 1983 five days after the bombing 
among this literature was the armed resistance units 
communique claiming responsibility for the 11783 bombing of the 
capitol building the document said 
the bomb severely damaged a corridor and lounge outside the 
senate chamber the same organization name was used by those who 
placed the may 1983 bomb outside the army war college at fort 
mcnair 
another document said although not cispes literature the 
communique claiming responsibility for the 11783 bombing of the 
us capitol building was passed out along with the cispes 
literature 
a document on the fort mcnair bombing said an unidentified 
individual contacted a local radio station in washington dc a 
few days after the bombing and said we are in solidarity with 
the people of el salvador and guatemala and have taken action 
because people are trained at the nwc national war college 
in another document fbi agents were told determine extent 
and nature of cispes involvement in organizingsupporting terrorist 
activities within the united states with particular attention 
placed on the forthcoming political conventions and 1984 olympic 
games 
fbi spokesman ray mcelhaney denied the investigation was 
political saying it had a narrow focus and was limited to those 
leaders and key members of cispes to ascertain if they were 
involved in illegal support of the fmln a foreign terrorist 
organization 
the fmln is the frente farabundo marti para la liberacion 
nacional a resistance group fighting the usbacked government of 
el salvador 
field offices were instructed not to interfere with first 
amendment rights of cispes members he said

president reagan this week will make one last 
try at rearranging the national agenda as he sends congress a 11 
trillion budget for fiscal year 1989 but it will be just a ghost 
of budgets past 
with neither side spoiling for an electionyear budget brawl 
the new reagan spending plan appears more designed to shun 
confrontation with congress than to stake out new ground 
to be sure the budget submitted next thursday will sound 
encores for familiar reagan tunes selling off amtrak abolishing 
the interstate commerce commission privatizing regional power 
authorities 
but it is also laden with politically appealing offerings a 1 
billionplus program for aids research modernization of the 
nations air control system a speedup of the environmental 
superfund program and more funds for orbiting a manned space 
station 
the biggest white house concession this year has already been 
made the prechristmas agreement with congress to let defense 
spending authority rise by only 2 percent since thats less than 
last years 44 percent rate of inflation such an increase is 
tantamount to a defense spending cut the first ever during the 
reagan years 
reagans earlier spending plans which envisioned the massacre 
of dozens of federal agencies and programs may have been more 
ambitious than the new one but never were very successful not a 
single agency reagan targeted for extinction has ever been 
abolished 
this will be reagans final fullfledged budget he will submit 
one next january but it will quickly be refashioned by the next 
president just as reagan redid the budget plan prepared in early 
1981 by former president jimmy carter 
that february a month after his inauguration reagan sent 
congress a stark budget calling for deep domestic spending 
reductions a huge tax cut and the promise of a balanced budget by 
1984 
while going along with the tax cuts encompassed in reagans 
first budget congress has never shown much enthusiasm for the 
spendingcut side of the equation 
congress cut income taxes left domestic spending pretty much 
alone and went along with reagans request for a defense buildup 
the annual budget deficit at 78 billion when reagan took office 
is now hovering at near 150 billion 
many aspects of this years budget have been predetermined by an 
agreement the white house struck with congress late last year so 
members of congress cant scream as they have in the past about 
reagans defense request 
that agreement calls for defense spending authority for fiscal 
1989 which begins next oct 1 of 2995 billion thats up 2 
percent from the current level 
the compromise also calls for 14 billion in new revenues 
including 35 billion from the sale of government assets while 
the administration is expected to put in another 8 billion or so 
in asset sales there wont be any surprises on taxes in the budget 
and the pact also calls for shrinking the federal budget deficit 
from 148 billion of fiscal 1987 to 136 billion the target called 
for in the revised grammrudman deficitreduction law 
the administration assuming that the economy will expand this 
year at 24 percent and at 35 percent in 1989 claims it will be 
able to meet that 136 billion through assorted domestic spending 
cuts but that it will be close 
the congressional budget office using more pessimistic 
assumptions of 18 percent growth in 1988 and 26 percent in 1989 
suggested recently that the deficit could grow to 176 billion even 
under the agreement between the white house and congress 
the deficit shrinks when the economy speeds up because more 
revenues come into the treasury and it rises when the economy 
slows 
it may be an academic issue under the budget law 
administration figures are used in deciding whether the 
grammrudman requirements have been met a subtlety that may allow 
the year to pass without a knockdown budget fight 
another reason why there may be less budget acrimony this year 
congress will have less time to deal with the issue not only is 
the spending plan being submitted a month later than usual but 
with party conventions comning up in the summer followed by 
elections members of congress will have other things on their 
mind the whole process will be compressed 
we have an agreement with congress i think the rhetoric 
will be a lot less this year says budget director james c 
miller iii 
still the new reagan budget will recycle if halfheartedly 
many past reagan proposals including those for selling off 
government assets to the private sector 
do not be surprised that the presidents budget will reflect 
his priorities miller says 
expected to be reproposed are plans to sell amtrack rail 
passenger service small business administration loans naval 
petroleum reserves regional power marketing authorities and public 
housing projects 
the new reagan budget according to internal budget documents 
obtained by the associated press also will renew earlier proposals 
to eliminate mass transit grants abolish the interstate commerce 
commission and the economic development administration 
however spared from reagans budget knife this time will be the 
legal services corporation which the adminstration has given up 
on trying to terminate instead deep cuts will be proposed 
few in congress or in the administration however consider it 
likely that congress this year will accept proposed reagan program 
cuts that have been repeatedly rejected in years past 
still in the absence of a budget accord the grammrudman law 
will take control of the situation mandating acrosstheboard 
cuts 
actually even though the grammrudman law calls for a deficit 
in fiscal 1989 which begins next oct 1 of 136 billion there 
is actually a 10 billion margin of error built into the law 
that means that if congress can cut the deficit to 146 billion 
or less lawmakers can head home for the year without further worry 
about dealing with the deficit this year 
if a recession hits during 1988 then the picture changes 
dramatically the deficit will probably mushroom back over 200 
billion where it was in 1985 and 1986 as tax revenues fall 
however the grammrudman law has a built in safety valve in 
the case of a recession the deficit targets are waived

the nations labor leaders can look 
back on 1987 as the best year of a bleak decade but a tide of 
changing economic forces is still rolling against them 
despite having regained some of the political and bargaining 
clout they lost in the early 1980s unions are continuing to lose 
members amidst the greatest peacetime spurt of job creation in the 
nations history 
where they are the weakest is among women minorities and 
immigrants who will fill 85 percent of the new jobs created between 
now and the year 2000 according to projections by the governments 
bureau of labor statistics 
a new 13 million aflcio media campaign following up on offers 
of lowinterest credit cards prepaid legal insurance and other 
lures aimed at potential whitecollar and pinkcollar recruits is 
still in its infancy 
the payoff is yet to be seen in absolute terms union 
membership among blacks and women increased by 9000 and 40000 
respectively last year but the percentage of nonunion workers in 
both groups also rose 
and despite the restoration of more than 300000 assembly line 
jobs in 1987 union membership among manufacturing workers 
organized labors biggest base of support for four decades 
declined by 178000 according to government figures 
essentially unions in the past year have moved the ball out 
from what had been a goalline stance to the 7yard line says 
richard belous a labor market analyst for the conference board a 
business research house the bottom line is that they are still 
very much in the hole 
nonetheless union chiefs on the aflcios 36member 
policymaking executive council convening at this beachside resort 
for their annual winter meeting this weekend have reason to be 
optimistic for the first time this decade 
they have become a force again in both the economic and 
political arenas 
unions last year succeeded in negotiating frontloaded contracts 
with the biggest wage gains and benefits coming early reversing a 
pattern of concessionary bargaining and endloaded contracts in the 
early 1980s 
with the exception of the meatpacking airline and steel 
industries unionized workers last year received roughly the same 
36 percent wage and benefit increases of nonunion workers 
enabling them to maintain a 36 percent overall wage advantage 
divisive twotier contracts in which newly hired workers can 
never hope to catch up with veteran employees were still being 
signed in some industries like meatpacking 
but those split pay levels were eliminated or the wage gaps at 
least were greatly reduced among several other employer groups 
such as aerospace plants airlines and food stores 
and in exchange for productivity improvements from decreased 
featherbedding stronger job guarantees and new restrictions on 
subcontracting work to foreign or domestic nonunion suppliers were 
bargained in the auto mining and steel industries 
those developments coupled with the reinvigoration of a 
legislative agenda dormant for the past eight years have aflcio 
president lane kirkland now speaking of the resurgent labor 
movement a term he was unwilling to adopt just a year ago 
as the 28 owners of the national football league proved 
employers are still more than willing seven years later to follow 
president reagans example with air traffic controllers and hire 
strikebreakers 
while the aflcio staked what some critics consider too many 
chips on the football players union and suffered a major symbolic 
loss with the failure of their strike it won several less visible 
but no less significant victories in other areas 
seventy percent of the air traffic controllers hired to replace 
the 11000 strikers fired by reagan in 1981 voted to form a new 
union and the adolph coors co knuckled under to a decadeold 
boycott of its beer and agreed to allow unhindered union elections 
at its breweries and use union construction workers in building any 
new facilities 
having played a key role in restoring the senate to democratic 
control in 1986 unions last year also dusted off a congressional 
agenda that had been shelved since 1980 
only three months into 1987 the aflcio marshaled its allies in 
congress to help override president reagans veto of an 88 billion 
highway bill providing jobs for 700000 mostly union workers 
through the summer and into the fall unions were instrumental 
in mounting grassroots opposition to president reagans nomination 
of robert bork to the supreme court in october borks 
confirmation was defeated on a 4258 vote 
importcurbing trade bills the federations top legislative 
priority the past two years were passed by both the house and the 
senate a measure requiring 60 days advance notice of layoffs was 
attached to the senate version over intense opposition from the 
adminsitration and business lobbyists 
kirkland expects this year will be even more active with 
passage expected on several other laborendorsed measures 
including raising the minimum wage restricting use of nonunion 
workers and mandating childcare leaves 
veto override fights may become frequent and labor wont win 
them all kirkland predicts but the veto battle will be part 
of the 1988 political campaign

bertie and john weaver dont go out to a fancy 
restaurant or even share a romantic candlelight dinner to celebrate 
their wedding anniversary 
after 80 years of marriage the couple prefers a simple 
observance of the event that took place on july 27 1907 they just 
remember the good times and give thanks for the life theyve had 
together since their marriage at age 16 
weve had so many anniversaries that we dont make much 
todo over them anymore weaver once said 
the weavers who live in glenloch a rural community in heard 
county about 60 miles west of atlanta have had so many 
anniversaries in fact that theyve been honored as the longest 
married couple in the nation 
the distinction was bestowed on them by the worldwide marriage 
encounter an international nonprofit organization dedicated to 
the enrichment of all marriages 
charley anton and his wife idamarie coordinators for the group 
in atlanta found out about the weavers more than a year ago when a 
grandson nominated them for the honor the weavers held the 
distinction for the state of georgia last year and moved to 
national prominence this year 
the award is given each year on world marriage day which 
antons group marks on the second sunday of february this year it 
happens to fall on valentines day 
theyre really a warm gentle couple anton said 
theyre just amazed at the award said mary steed the 
couples daughter who lives near them and visits on weekends and 
if needed during the week they do a lot of talking and 
grumbling 
the weavers now both 96 have been ill recently and not up to 
talking with reporters about their lengthy marriage anton said 
but in a chat with anton weaver attributed the longevity of the 
relationship to the good lord watching over us working together 
respecting each others feelings being good to one another and 
being understanding with one another 
the simple life is the best life 
in a previous newspaper interview weaver said he and his wife 
get along as good as two people ever could i help her with 
anything she needs every now and then well bring up a quarrel 
but not often 
despite their age and fragile health weaver gets up each 
morning and makes breakfast for his wife 
married over the objections of mrs weavers family the couple 
had 13 children six still are living 50 grandchildren 87 
greatgrandchildren and seven greatgreatgrandchildren 
mrs weavers family objected to her choice of a husband because 
he was the son of a sawmill worker although the wedding was 
supposed to be secret her family found out and lined the road when 
weaver came to pick up his bride for the ceremony 
i took a back road and picked her up and headed for the 
justice of the peace said weaver who also was a sawmill worker 
the weavers reaction to being named as the longest married 
couple in the united states is mixed anton said on the one hand 
anton said theyre enjoying the attention but it has made them 
very much aware of their age

three months of violent protests have 
pushed this volatile nation to the point of political paralysis 
at the heart of the conflict is a stalemate between president 
hussain muhammad ershad and his tenacious opposition the upcoming 
parliamentary elections only have compounded the standoff 
ershad a former army general who seized power in a 1982 coup 
and subsequently was elected president refuses to accede to the 
chorus of protesters demanding his resignation 
the opposition which rarely articulates its ideology beyond 
saying ershad must go and the people want democracy 
persists in calling a general strike every few days in dhaka and 
other major cities 
the main opposition leaders sheik hasina and khaleda zia say 
the nearly 100 percent compliance with their strike initiatives is 
proof they have widespread support 
but random conversations with a score of merchants indicated 
that fear not politics is keeping the shops shuttered 
oh yes i close not because i support the strike but out of 
panic said abdul qader who sells housewares near the buriganga 
river if i open somebody will loot and burn that is why i 
close i lose money about 1200 takas 3750 in sales a day 
of that amount only about 312 represents profit for the 
35yearold shopkeeper who has a wife and two children 
bangladesh has not had a peaceful transition of power since it 
broke away from pakistan in 1971 
hasina daughter of an assassinated president and mrs zia 
wife of another assassinated president launched their antiershad 
campaign on nov 10 
since then confrontations between police and protesters have 
left 25 people dead according to the governments count 100 by 
hasinas tally 
in addition more than 100 people were killed during election 
day last wednesday most in clashes among supporters of rival 
candidates in local elections 
to try to counter the spiraling unrest ershad imposed emergency 
rule nov 27 banning public political activities by everyone 
except himself and permitting police to detain people indefinitely 
without charge 
on dec 6 he dissolved parliament and ordered new elections 
but hasina and mrs zia refused to settle for anything short of 
ershads resignation 
hasina head of the awami league and mrs zia leader of the 
bangladesh nationalist party are boycotting the march 3 
parliamentary elections contending ershad will rig the vote to 
favor his jatiya party 
we have to stop this election hasina said in an interview 
under him there cannot be a fair election 
siraj a 35yearold truck driver had another reason for not 
voting 
in 1986 i went to vote and was told i had already voted 
said siraj who like many bangladeshis uses one name 
a small crowd gathered as siraj spoke to a foreign reporter 
through an interpreter and one man heatedly told the trucker he 
had not spoken the truth 
siraj then retracted his remark 
ershads jatiya party which took 212 seats in the 1986 
parliamentary election is fielding candidates in all 300 
constituencies sixteen unopposed jatiya candidates already have 
been declared victors 
a hastily formed alliance of 73 small parties called the 
combined opposition party is contesting 270 seats the alliance is 
visible mostly through campaign slogans painted on public walls 
mrs zia whose husband president ziaur rahman was assassinated 
in 1981 referred to it as a briefcase party 
the thirdlargest party in the election is headed by retired 
col farooq rahman acknowledged mastermind of the 1975 
assassination of hasinas father president mujibur rahman 
farooq who says his funds come mostly from his consociates inc 
construction business in libya founded the freedom party last 
august and is running 110 candidates 
local and foreign analysts representing a broad range of 
ideologies say ershad permitted the creation of the freedom party 
in an effort to restrain hasina and the awami league which was her 
fathers party 
both ershad and farooq deny this 
despite the array of candidates including 302 independent and 
minorparty candidates the election will not provide a test of the 
countrys major political forces since hasinas and mrs zias 
parties are not running against ershads jatiya party 
this election is not going to solve any crisis so why are 
these elections being held asked anwar zahid who resigned as 
information minister last month to protest the decision to proceed 
with the vote 
he subsequently was expelled from the jatiya party 
the election that is now scheduled is a sham election zahid 
said in an interview 
there is a political stalemate the opposition cannot achieve 
the government cannot achieve there is neither victor nor 
vanquished and the victim is the nation

the historians who determined kurt 
waldheim knew of and did nothing to stop nazi atrocities were 
practically all his enemies socialists and jews an old friend 
and close aide to the president charged 
in their report the historians condemned waldheim for not 
objecting to the atrocities they said he must have been aware of as 
a german army intelligence officer in the balkans during world war 
ii but said it found no proof he committed war crimes 
today the west german news magazine der spiegel which 
published a telegram purportedly linking waldheim to the 
deportation of civilians to concentration camps during the war 
said the document was a fake and it apologized for printing it 
spiegel regrets that it presented this document to its 
readers as the proof of waldheims involvement and not with the 
necessary distance the magazine said it said a document expert 
bernhard haas had concluded the telegram was in all likelihood a 
fake 
the commission that studied waldheims wartime past did not have 
access to the original telegram 
the commission they were not his friends they were 
practically all his enemies karl gruber said friday the 
german is a socialist the others are of jewish descent he said 
referring to west german historian manfred messerschmidt and the 
five other members of the international panel 
commission chairman hans rudolf kurz a swiss historian 
rejected grubers allegations of bias saying the panels members 
were hired for their scientific expertise and had not acted as 
waldheims enemies 
in an interview with austrian television kurz reacted angrily 
to grubers comment about the governmentappointed panel being 
comprised of people of jewish descent 
he said he chose israeli professor yehuda wallach a jew 
because i have known him for many years as an outstanding 
scientist only later did he learn that british commission member 
gerald fleming was also jewish he added 
gruber a resistance fighter against the nazis was austrias 
first foreign minister after the war and brought waldheim into the 
diplomatic service his comments to italian television were 
broadcast on austrian radio 
chancellor franz vranitzky a socialist sent telegrams to each 
commission member apologizing for grubers remarks which he said 
have nothing in the slightest to do with the governments view of 
your work 
austrias jewish community in a telex to news organizations 
said grubers statement expressed the deepest hatred of jews 
vranitzkys government appointed the commission at waldheims 
request in september after the us justice department put the 
president on a watch list of undesirable aliens that bars him 
from the united states 
accusations that he committed war crimes arose during the former 
un secretarygenerals election campaign in 1986 
waldheims office said he will make a fiveminute address on 
national television monday but a spokesman said he could not 
disclose its contents 
the president has consistently refused to resign and said this 
week he will stay in office despite the historians report which 
left open the questions of guilt and moral responsibility the 
202page document was presented to the government monday 
about 500 intellectuals gathered outside waldheims offices in 
the imperial hofburg palace at dusk friday and handed in a petition 
demanding his resignation organizers said they collected 1200 
signatures 
another antiwaldheim demonstration by prominent intellectuals 
is planned for sunday 
when asked about grubers comment that he was a socialist 
messerschmidt described himself as a lifelong liberal who never has 
belonged to a political party critics of the commission should 
do their research better he said

and keys while the judge stood a few feet away posing for a 
campaign photograph 
circuit judge sam monk was posing on the front steps of the 
courthouse thursday and put his robe just inside the front doors 
only a few feet away he hid his keys in the robe after the 
photographer said they were making his pocket bulge 
asked what he thought about the thiefs brashness the judge 
said the kings english fails me in that question 
its obvious they knew what they were doing and who they were 
doing it to said presiding circuit judge malcolm street jr 
the church choir was not standing on the front steps 
this is just another glaring example of the lack of proper 
security in the county courthouse said monk locks have been 
changed at the courthouse and monk has had to change locks in and 
around his home

here is the text of president reagans radio 
address saturday which was prerecorded on thursday 
my fellow americans today i am meeting with mexican president 
miguel de la madrid in mazatlan mexico so ive prerecorded 
this radio talk over these last seven years maintaining a 
constructive and friendly relationship with our neighbors to the 
south has been one of the highest priorities of our administration 
as we review what has transpired there is every reason to be 
pleased the leaders of our two nations are aware that good 
relations and cooperation between us are invaluable to both our 
peoples and thats why the meetings between our top leadership 
have been frequent and our talks at those meeting comprehensive 
my meeting today with president de la madrid will cover a number 
of issues from economic concerns to our mutual commitment to 
fight drug traffickers to the security challenges facing the 
hemisphere 
mexico is our fourth largest trading partner and we 
correspondingly are mexicos largest trading partner our 
commercial ties are strong and of great benefit to people on both 
sides of the border weve worked hard to make it that way last 
november we signed a new frameword understanding that underscored 
our special trade and investment relationship 
during our meetings in mazatlan president de la madrid and i 
will reaffirm our commitment to take advantage of every opportunity 
to strengthen the commercial ties between our peoples one thing 
that cannot be overemphasized is that a healthy and expanding 
mexican economy is in the interest of the united states we want 
mexico to grow and prosper and thats why weve done our best and 
will continue to do our best to help find solutions to the vexing 
problems of mexicos international debt 
innovative marketbased methods of managing this burden are 
being explored such as mexicos offer to exchange debt for 
longterm bonds at the same time weve been working with our 
mexican counterparts on such things as a new textile accord a 
telecommunications agreement and a new civil aviation agreement 
which is in the final stages of negotiations 
i hope that one day all of this will be seen as the initial 
steps leading toward an historic freeing of commerce and trade 
throughout the continent were just now beginning to tap the 
unmeasurable potential between mexico and the united states 
this can certainly be seen in the immigration reform and control 
act passed by congress in 1986 this law offers protections for 
more than a million undocumented immigrants living in the united 
states many of whom are from mexico it provides a means for them 
to find legal employment in our country and to participate openly 
and freely in our society 
population movement and employment are subjects being examined 
closely by joint us and mexican commissions a study of the issues 
and frank dialogue between us is essential and i am gratified by 
the responsible longterm approach the mexican government is taking 
in this sensitive area we have found that there are honest and 
concerned officials on both sides of the border who are dedicated 
to the same ideals 
nowhere is that more clear than in the battle against drug 
traffickers american and mexican policemen and law enforcement 
officials have lost their lives in this fight weve been allies 
with brave individuals men and women of integrity who are putting 
their lives on the line against this evil and the corruption and 
bloodshed that follows in its trail 
i might add that each and every one of us can make a 
contribution to winning this war against drugs first by refusing 
to use illegal drugs ourselves and second by helping others to 
get off drugs and the traffickers would go out of business if 
people quit buying illegal drugs thats the real solution and 
its up to each and every one of us to be a part of the solution 
finally my talks with president de la madrid will also cover 
the security threat to this hemisphere since 1980 weve witnessed 
an impressive expansion of democracy throughout the americas 
however this progress cannot be taken for granted the 
establishment of totalitarian regimes supported by cuba and the 
soviet union is a threat to stability and freedom nowhere is that 
threat more acute than in central america 
i would hope that the united states and mexico will find common 
interest in opposing any such totalitarian threat the peoples and 
governments of the united states and mexico are and ought to be 
friends our national interests dictate it our peoples demand it 
it is in this spirit that i meet today with president de la madrid 
i will pass on to the people of mexico your very best wishes 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

a magazine said today that a 
document purportedly linking austrian president kurt waldheim to 
the deportation of civilians to concentration camps during world 
war ii was a fake and it apologized for publishing it 
spiegel regrets that it presented this document to its 
readers as the proof of waldheims involvement and not with the 
necessary distance the der spiegal news magazine said in its 
latest edition 
der spiegel said bernhard haas a document expert from 
stuttgart concluded that the military telegram was in all 
likelihood a fake 
the telegram published feb 8 allegedly linked waldheim a 
former un secretarygeneral to the deportation of more than 
4000 civilians while he served as an officer in the german army in 
yugoslavia in 1942 
the west german magazine published the text of the telegram two 
weeks ago which it said for the first time will prove austrian 
president kurt waldheims complicity in war crimes during world war 
ii 
the document published said very urgent lieutenant kurt 
waldheim from the staff of general stahl demands that 4224 
prisoners from kozara most of them women and children and 
approximately 15 percent older men be sent on their way 3514 to 
grubisino polje and 730 to zemun 
both places were prison camps near belgrade during world war ii 
the hamburgbased magazine said the document was discovered by 
yugoslav military historian dusan plenca spiegel has not said how 
it obtained the document 
waldheim has consistently denied allegations he participated in 
war crimes while serving with the german army in the balkans during 
the war 
after der spiegel published the document a waldheim spokesman 
dismissed it as a probable fake 
a panel of historians assigned to study waldheims past 
presented its report to the austrian government last monday and 
condemned the president for not objecting to atrocities it 
concluded he must have known about 
but the commission also said it found no proof waldheim actually 
participated in war crimes it did not have access to the original 
telegram published in der spiegel 
plenca never produced the original document the commission 
appealed unsuccessfully to the yugoslav government to help it find 
the original 
yugoslavia placed waldheim on a list of suspected war criminals 
and asked for his extradition from austria in 1947 but it never 
pursued the extradition request and never publicly explained why 
yugoslavias tanjug news agency said this week that the telegram 
was a forgery 
tanjug said a yugoslav commission formed of historians 
archivists and other experts came to the conclusion that the 
telegram is not an authentic document and that there exists a 
founded suspicion that it is a forgery

panama began four days of carnival this 
weekend with the countrys future as unpredictable as the route of 
shambling revelers wending from one sidewalk beer stall to another 
the festival was expected to be subdued this year clouded by 
months of political unrest and the recent indictments in the united 
states of the countrys de facto leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega he was charged in miami and tampa fla with drug 
trafficking and money laundering 
the indictments deepened the polarization of a nation already 
sharply split along economic lines they caused noriega to try to 
reinforce his power by criticizing the united states and left his 
opponents confused 
if there ever was a chance that noriega would relinquish power 
gracefully the indictments in florida appear to have quashed it 
said one european diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
leaders of panamas growing opposition movement acknowledge that 
their goal of removing the general was made more difficult by the 
indictments and subsequent congressional testimony last week by 
several former noriega associates 
the grand juries in miami and tampa and the testimony of 
noriegas former friends lent weight to what the opposition has 
been charging all along that the general is up to his jowls in 
corruption 
but what can we do now asked aurelio barria president of 
the panamanian chamber of commerce and industry and a leading 
opposition figure who returned home two weeks ago after several 
months of selfimposed exile 
the opposition has ruled out further demonstrations like the 
ones that shook the country last summer when noriega sent the army 
into the streets with guns clubs and tear gas 
at least three people were killed and hundreds injured in the 
disturbances organized by the national civic crusade a coalition 
of civic professional labor and other groups 
subsequent calls for popular demonstrations met with dwindling 
enthusiasm 
we just cant ask people to go out in the streets and face 
that kind of repression said ricardo arias calderon the 
president of the christian democratic party and another leading 
opposition figure 
barria arias calderon and other opposition leaders spoke 
hopefully of arranging the generals ouster through talks with his 
supporters in the democratic revolutionary party which is closely 
linked to panamas military 
but they acknowledged that they may not be able to arrange such 
talks and they appeared to have no other firm course of action to 
oust the general from his post as head of panamas defense forces 
barria spoke of the possibilities of a coup by junior officers 
a presidential order removing noriega a nationwide general strike 
greater involvement in the ouster effort by the roman catholic 
church and united diplomatic and financial pressure by other latin 
american nations 
opposition leaders began talking about a general strike a week 
ago but barrios said they were still discussing the action with 
various economic factions and no date has been set for the 
shutdown attempt previous strikes have been only partly effective 
and few officers in the military seem to command enough respect 
to launch a successful coup 
barria said he and other opposition leaders have personally 
taken their case to the presidents of argentina venezuela brazil 
guatemala and uruguay but none of those leaders has yet spoken out 
against noriega 
nor has the roman catholic church widely respected in this 
predominantly catholic country given the opposition movement the 
support that barria and others would like to see 
president eric arturo delvalle widely seen as a puppet dancing 
on noriegas strings has the constitutional authority to dismiss 
the general but few believe he will do it 
still delvalle was the object of much speculation grafitti 
appeared on walls in panama city saying watch out for delvalle 
he was absent thursday night when an estimated 8000 people 
crowded into a panama city convention center to pay homage to gen 
noriega on his birthday either his 50th or 54th depending on 
differing records 
noriegas triumphant appearance at the gathering capped a week 
of speeches around the country in which he blamed his troubles on a 
plot by the reagan administration to renege on a 1977 treaty that 
will turn over control of the panama canal to panama at the turn of 
the century 
that accusation is vigorously denied in washington but noriega 
has been using it for months to whip up antius sentiment 
noriega also demanded the removal of the us southern command 
from panama which the pentagon and the white house initially 
interpreted as a call for the transfer of some 10000 servicemen 
and their 20000 dependents from panamanian soil 
washington immediately rejected that saying the the american 
troops were legally in the country and would remain here to protect 
the canal until it is handed over to panama on dec 31 1999 
noriega later said he was referring only to the headquarters 
unit responsible for us strategic military planning american 
military sources said that would involve the removal of only about 
300 officers and men 
during his birthday speech noriegas biggest ovation came when 
he declared if they want me out theyll have to kill me

adolfo calero a leader of usbacked 
guerrillas in nicaragua denied on saturday that his troops trained 
in panama or received funds from the panamanian government 
we never had anyone training in panama calero said i 
dont know anything about it we have absolutely nothing to do with 
panama nor with the panamanian government 
we have never received any money from panamanian sources he 
said 
caleros comments in an interview after appealing to a 
convention of us conservatives to send donations to his cause 
was his first reaction to congressional testimony on wednesday by a 
former top panamanian intelligence officer jose i blandon 
blandon told a senate foreign relations subcommittee that panama 
provided military training for the rebels after a 1985 request from 
thenwhite house aide oliver north at the time direct us 
assistance to the rebels was banned by law 
in addition gen manuel antonio noriega the panamanian 
military leader whose ouster the reagan administration is urging 
said last week that he and another former white house aide john 
poindexter discussed the possibility of a us invasion of 
nicaragua us government spokesmen have denied such talks took 
place 
asked if he thought noriega who was indicted last week by a 
grand jury on drug charges fabricated the story about invasion 
plans to divert attention from his current fight with the united 
states calero replied yes hes the one in hot water 
the testimony by blandon and the comments by noriega have raised 
several questions including was the united states using panama to 
help the nicaraguan rebels at a time direct us assistance was 
outlawed 
also at issue is the relationship between the united states and 
noriega who has now been accused of criminality by a grand jury 
according to blandons testimony the cia gave noriega classified 
reports on antireagan administration senators 
the cia denied the allegation but sen alfonse damato rny 
said the fact of the matter is that it has been well know that 
noriega the thug and racketeer has been on the payroll of the 
cia for many years and remained there i am given to understand 
until rather recently 
in his speech to the annual conservative political action 
conference calero lamented anew congressional rejection of an 
administration request for 362 million in aid for the nicaraguan 
resistance 
he solicited private donations but said private support 
cannot substitute for us government aid 
however we do need private support of a humanitarian or 
nonlethal nature calero said 
the reagan administration whose solicitation of private funds 
for the contras in previous years created a huge furor has 
publicized a white house memo ordering officials to take no part in 
private fund raising 
calero said the vote against contra aid will force the 
resistance forces to reduce their activities in the coming year 
but he added we will continue the struggle no matter what 
opponents of the us government assistance said it would harm a 
peace plan signed by nicaragua and other governments in the region

nato members must work to reinvigorate the western 
alliance because the arms control treaty with the soviets does not 
mean the kremlin has given up its ambitions of world dominance 
senate majority leader robert c byrd said saturday 
byrd dwva delivering his partys weekly radio address said 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty leaves nagging 
questions 
where is the evidence that a halfcentury of soviet pursuit of 
dominance and control has been bridled asked byrd who is 
leading a bipartisan congressional delegation that is consulting 
with european leaders 
we are heartened to find that nato leaders view the new soviet 
leadership with a healthy dose of realism he said we know 
that our adversary has not abandoned its historic goals on the 
world scene 
byrd said western europe and the united states are the only 
real foil to soviet expansionism and should use the treaty as 
an invitation to fashion a stronger alliance among ourselves 
the key to peace is cohesion he said we must redeclare 
ourselves as an alliance the soviets must be convinced of our 
public support the depth and flexibility of our armed response 
and our staying power 
we are still far from a time when the world is in perfect 
balance byrd said although nuclear deterrence is an essential 
component in the pursuit of peace nato must soon offer a strong

here is the text of the democratic radio address 
delivered saturday by senate majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva 
this is senate majority leader robert byrd 1988 promises to 
bring about a massive shift in the way most of the free world sizes 
up its own security a new arms control treaty the inf treaty 
is before the senate people in this country and in europe are 
concerned about what it means to their future 
for that reason i led a bipartisan delegation this week to five 
nato countries to raise some crucial questions and to pledge to 
european leaders that americas commitment to nato is unshakable 
unchanged and undiminished 
the signing of the inf treaty has opened the door to new 
optimism new uncertainties and new risks for nato the treaty is 
an invitation to fashion a stronger alliance among ourselves and a 
more pragmatic strategy toward the soviets 
we were heartened to find that nato leaders view the new soviet 
leadership with a healthy dose of realism 
much of their skepticism and ours can be laid to mr 
gorbachevs stunning achievement in eclipsing his predecessors in 
style and message at times he seems to have almost mesmerized 
western publics with the prospect of detente with his adversaries 
abroad and the trappings of glasnost at home 
american polls are now recording a trust toward this russian 
leader where none existed before yet there are some of us who are 
still nagged by questions 
where is the evidence that a halfcentury of soviet pursuit of 
dominance and control has been bridled 
why should we risk deterrence on the professed good will of a 
man only three years into power glasnost must not be confused with 
the freedom of the press or freedom of speech by western standards 
the inf treaty is in large measure due to the courage and the 
cohesion of the west we proved that together we are the match 
for any aggressor that we are the only real foil to soviet 
expansionism 
we know that our adversary has not abandoned its historic goals 
on the world scene so our course should be one of new initiative 
to constantly test the new soviet leadership under gorbachev 
the leaders we consulted this week agreed that nato has a 
twofold task first to fashion sound solutions for our common 
defense and our common approach to a skillful protagonist second 
to persuade our peoples of the realities we face 
our message must be clear and constant arms control is not an 
end in itself it is a means to an end the end being a more secure 
western alliance 
i was born at a time when woodrow wilson proclaimed world war i 
the war to end all wars and i was a young man when franklin 
roosevelt galvanized a nation with his call to arms 
a generation has come of age since america and europe last 
fought side by side that that generation has been spared the 
trauma of war is a credit to the trust and strength we have given 
on both sides of the atlantic 
in the coming months we must declare our unity of purpose not 
just to the soviets but to the american people and to the people 
of europe 
we know we are still far from a time when the world is in 
perfect balance although nuclear deterrence is an essential 
component in the pursuit of peace nato must soon offer a strong 
proposal on conventional and chemical weapons control 
in the end the key to peace is cohesion we must redeclare 
ourselves an alliance the soviets must be convinced of our public 
support the depth and flexibility of our armed response and our 
staying power 
the leaders in europe with whom we met share our concerns they 
are realistic about mr gorbachev and they welcomed strong american 
leadership of the nato alliance we pledged to them our support of 
the alliance and the continued commitment of the american people to 
the common destiny of europe and america for europes security is 
our security

an american destroyer wary of another 
starktype attack fired flares at an iraqi bomber racing toward a 
convoy of usflagged kuwaiti tankers in the persian gulf us 
military officials said saturday 
the plane a sovietbuilt tu16 badger veered sharply away from 
the convoy just before it launched two missiles friday night the 
missiles exploded in a flash on the horizon a minute or so later 
according to journalists aboard the destroyer chandler 
on may 17 two exocet missiles fired by an iraqi f1 mirage hit 
the missile frigate uss stark killing 37 us sailors iraq said 
the attack was a mistake 
fridays incident was the second time in five days that an iraqi 
aircraft on a raid against iranian targets had come within eight 
miles of a us warship in the central gulf as it prepared to fire 
its missiles 
us military sources said officers aboard the battle cruiser 
richmond k turner had a tense moment last sunday night when 
they thought an iraqi missile had been fired at their ship that 
missile also launched from a badger bomber was visible when fired 
and when it exploded said the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
there was no word on what the fridays projectiles actually hit 
but iraq announced it had carried out an air strike against two 
large maritime targets near iranheld sirri island at 908 pm 
the same time as the chandlers sighting 
sirri is a littleused oil terminal about 60 miles northwest of 
dubai and 40 miles from the iran coast there was no other 
verification of the claimed attack 
cmdr steve smith skipper of the 8300ton chandler told 
members of the pentagonorganized news pool that iraqi pilots often 
fire at radar blips without being sure of what they are 
having watched the geometry of their attacks for some time i 
was concerned that he would be firing his missile while he was 
heading toward us he informed his crew by ships intercom 
many us officers sailing the gulf say their greatest single 
concern is an errant iraqi air attack such as that which 
devastated the stark 
iraq later apologized for the attack and agreed to pay 
compensation to the us government and the victims families the 
state department said recently it was in the final stages of 
preparing claims 
the chandler was one of two warships escorting the upbound 
convoy which included four of the 11 stateowned kuwaiti tankers 
reregistered under the stars and stripes last year for protection 
from iranian attack iran considers kuwait an ally of iraq in their 
sevenyear war 
us warships routinely go on top alert when iraqi warplanes 
show up on radar and the chandlers crew was at general 
quarters or battle stations as the badger was tracked down the 
gulf and looped eastward toward its target 
the ships phalanx gun designed to hurl a storm of radarguided 
shells at an incoming cruise missile was on automatic and its own 
missiles and stinger antiaircraft teams were ready to fire 
as the iraqi jet turned behind the convoy and appeared to head 
for the trailing chandler the destroyer fired two flares from a 
5inch gun and radioed the pilot to change course smith said the 
pilot spoke poor english and did not seem to understand but veered 
away immediately when the flares lit up 
smith said it was the closest an iraqi plane had come to the 
chandler since its arrival nov 25 the ship originally built for 
the iranian navy but never delivered is specially equipped to 
monitor air activity 
the skipper also said the iraqi badger a twinengine jet 
bomber carried chinesemade c601 missiles rather than the 
frenchbuilt exocets normally used by baghdads air forces 
it was apparently the first disclosure that iraq uses the c601 
an airtoground version of the silkworm antiship missile that 
china has furnished to iran the basic design is soviet and more 
than 30 years old 
meanwhile a danish supertanker crippled in a mysterious attack 
on thursday continued under tow to a shipyard outside the gulf 
gulf shipping executives and military sources in the united 
states said there were indications that the 339000ton ship was 
hit by an iraqi missile rather than an iranian helicopter as 
first reported 
one seaman was killed and three others injured in the attack on 
the tanker kate maersk which was badly damaged by fire 
the us sources speaking on condition of anonymity said there 
was no helicopter in the vicinity but noted that iraq had claimed 
an air raid on a large naval target about the time of the 
attack 
salvage officials also speaking privately said the tanker had 
what one called a gigantic entry hole in its superstructure 
suggesting a hit by a large exocettype missile

a large windowless room here has witnessed 
the assassination of an overbearing naval commander and mass 
firings when officers failed to follow orders it has seen treaties 
broken and weapons used up 
but not a drop of blood has been spilled the room on the campus 
of the naval war college is used for war games a serious pastime 
that draws participants from around the world 
players call their activity aided by maps and computers fun 
and exhilarating but war gaming is played as the next best thing 
to the real thing and even the scenarios are top secret 
we try to stimulate the thinking process of these players 
said navy cmdr tim barker who acts as umpire keeping players 
within the confines of the possible and showing them the 
consequences of their decisions 
should i make my boats report should i move my boats into the 
area should we respond to terrorist activity all these things are 
being played out he said 
on occasion war games are handy in light of current events 
when the united states began providing naval protection last 
summer to usflagged oil tankers in the persian gulf the war 
gaming staff played it out 
we didnt come up with any surprises said capt joseph 
hurlburt who has since retired as head of the college war gaming 
department he wouldnt elaborate but shook his head no when 
asked if the persian gulf situation might explode 
but war gaming cant predict all reallife actions as shown by 
a letter displayed in the lobby that was written to the war 
college by adm chester nimitz commander in the pacific during 
world war ii 
the war with japan had been reenacted in the game rooms at 
the naval war college by so many people and in so many different 
ways nimitz wrote that nothing that happened during the war 
was a surprise absolutely nothing except the japanese suicide 
kamikaze tactics toward the end of the war we had not visualized 
these 
often games produce no clear winner instead the objective is 
to test theories develop trends build consensus and assess 
technology and logistics and to give war college students an arena 
in which to practice what theyve learned 
when a war game is on the building is offlimits to outsiders 
but during a recent rare visit monitor screens blinked with 
numbers and in big red letters the word classified other 
screens showed maps indicating the locations of ships submarines 
and aircraft 
the notion of twosided war games in which players pretend to be 
the adversary is relatively modern it was invented early in this 
century in prussia and refined between the two world wars 
today war games are sometimes played in seminars where the 
armaments and battle lines are drawn in the imagination but the 
naval war college prides itself on its use of computers as a 
resource for reality they give more dimension to the simulation by 
bringing in political variables and millions of facts 
computers hold the information from which the gamesters recreate 
the world including statistics on the shape and climate of ports 
the inclinations of their inhabitants and the details of other 
countries ships aircraft and bombs 
the number of players varies greatly from a dozen to hundreds 
depending on the complexity 
each summer world war iii begins anew played out in three weeks 
with 1200 participants there are nato games and games with other 
allies 
players are assigned to a force in computerequipped rooms 
called cells one is designated the red cell for communist 
forces cmdr robert simeral is a navy intelligence expert with 
intimate knowledge of the soviet union so he often plays the 
soviet side 
the goal of the red cell is to play a consistent red threat 
however you can never really crack the skulls of the soviets he 
said pointing up a flaw inherent in war games the best you can 
do is imitate the enemy 
each game takes on a life of its own animated by the players 
and their options simeral said tempers flare people get fired 
military leaders get upset with the civilian command you get an 
acting president firing a commander in charge of the pacific for 
contradicting policy 
the professional warriors all stressed that the ultimate 
objective of trying out such scenarios is to keep the peace said 
barker we dont necessarily want a good juicy war but to make 
people think about it

some law enforcement and other government 
officials are challenging the credibility of witnesses who gave the 
senate a startling detailed account of ties between latin american 
leaders and a huge colombian drug cartel 
but the two senators who ran last weeks hearings massachusetts 
democrat john kerry and new york republican alfonse damato are 
unbowed by the criticism and promise more revelations to come 
when youre trying to prosecute the devil said kerry 
referring to panamanian strongman manual noriega you dont go to 
heaven for the witnesses 
though noriega who denies all charges is under federal 
drugtrafficking indictments in miami and tampa and the 
administration has distanced itself from its onetime ally some 
officials are challenging parts of the senate testimony as 
undocumented and tainted by the criminal background of key 
witnesses 
the critics include vice president george bush officials of the 
drug enforcement administration the us attorney in miami and 
democrat david boren chairman of the senate intelligence committee 
kerry is chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee 
on terrorism and narcotics which has spent the past year 
investigating ties among latin american leaders and drug kingpins 
in colombia 
last weeks hearings produced dramatic testimony from jose i 
blandon a former close associate of noriega who was fired last 
month and ramon milian rodriguez an accountant who is serving a 
43year prison term for laundering money for the drug cartel 
at one point blandon said the cia had provided noriega with 
details about the personal lives of us senators 
the cia categorically denied that assertion boren traveling in 
europe said he had no reason to believe that there is any 
truth to the charge 
kerry said blandon was a very credible witness i havent 
talked yet to sen boren about his statement but i intend to when 
he returns from europe 
damato who has been interested for years in the way drugs 
reach the united states sided with kerry blandon is credible 
damato said i dont know about the truth of every single 
statement he made but an awful lot of what he said can be checked 
out and has been fully checked out 
blandon also said that two hours before the us invasion of 
grenada on oct 25 1983 bush passed a warning to cuban president 
fidel castro that cuban troops shouldnt oppose the us action on 
the caribbean island 
bush said hed never given such a warning 
rodriguez testified about the money laundering operations of the 
drug cartel based in medellin colombia he asserted that the 
cartel had helped bankroll the usbacked nicaraguan rebels and 
also said he received money from the cia 
echoing complaints of federal drug agents richard gregory 
chief deputy us attorney in miami said when rodriguez was 
arrested in 1983 he never told us any of the things hes talking 
about now ive talked to the agents in this office who worked on 
his case and they dont believe him every time anything reached 
headline status in the last five years hed say he knew about it 
when us attorney leon kellner sought the indictment in miami 
against noriega returned two weeks ago rodriguez wasnt used 
gregory said 
gregory also said investigators from kerrys subcommittee were 
told that rodriguez wasnt credible but kerry used him anyway 
you know said kerry if you go back to the irancontra 
hearings there were witnesses who came forward with totally 
different stories totally inconsistent with each other day after 
day that has not appeared here witness after witness has 
corroborated the money laundering corroborated the drug network 
corroborated the names 
kerry added that i certainly dont quickly forget the fact 
that there were long and indignant and repeated denials by the 
white house and others about selling arms to iran there were long 
and repeated denials by the cia and state department about those 
and many other things including illegal support of the contras 
damato agreed a lot of people dont want to believe the 
things that blandon and rodriguez are saying so their credibility 
is attacked he said but if you look at it very closely an 
awful lot of what they are saying has been corroborated by 
documentation by statements from other people the international 
drug trafficking problem is very serious and it wont go away by 
attacking someones credibility 
when the hearings resume next month kerry says he plans to 
focus on the alleged connections among the drug cartel the contras 
and the cia

killer bees from south america will probably begin 
swarming into the united states in the next year or two and any 
attempt to head them off at the border is likely to fail experts 
predicted saturday 
the nasty aggressive bees have already reached southern mexico 
and are winging northward at a rate of 200 or 300 miles a year one 
authority said they might even hit brownsville texas late this 
year 
us and mexican officials have set up a brz or bee regulated 
zone in southern mexico in an effort to at least slow down the 
intruders 
however experts at a conference of the american association for 
the advancement of science said saturday that the arrival of the 
africanized bees is inevitable although they are not sure how far 
north the bees will spread some believe they will be limited to 
the warm southern states while others say they might spread over 
much of the nation 
in my view to eradicate a social insect is almost 
impossible said david w roubik a staff scientist with the 
smithsonian tropical research institute in balboa panama 
its too hard to get every last one he said any mass 
eradication program would be a filter i dont see any possibility 
of ridding the americas of africanized bees 
the bees descended from south african bees that escaped from a 
researcher in brazil in 1956 in south and central america they 
have largely displaced their gentler cousins descended from 
european bees 
unlike ordinary honeybees the africanized variety is easily 
riled and hundreds may attack unsuspecting intruders who go near 
their nests leading to the popular name killer bees they 
sometimes kill animals and people with their stings 
the africanized bees are thought to be a major threat to the 
us beekeeping industry commercially maintained bees are 
important for pollinating crops ranging from almonds to 
blueberries and the africanized bees are poor pollinators 
killer bees frequently take over commercial hives where they 
are difficult to handle they are poor honey makers and they 
frequently pack up and fly off without warning 
in a report prepared for the meeting orley r taylor of the 
university of kansas predicted the arrival of the bees in texas 
later this year he said the bees will clearly have an impact in 
the united states but whether it will be in the billions of 
dollars or only in the tens of millions over the next 20 years is 
not yet clear 
an effort to halt the bees at the narrowest point in mexico the 
isthmus of tehuantepec already shows signs of failing officials 
hoping to trap and kill the bees in a belt across the isthmus have 
already had to fall back to a second line of defense 
like several other experts scheduled to speak at the meeting al 
dietz of the university of georgia was not able to attend because 
of bad weather in boston but his research report was read to the 
conference 
he said the bees were able to survive as successfully as 
european bees in the cold mountains of argentina even when covered 
with snow for a month he said they might survive in the united 
states south of the 40 degree latitude which crosses the country 
from philadelphia to denver to northern california 
suzanne wt batra of the us department of agriculture said 
she believes they will thrive along the coasts as far north as 
washington state and boston but live only in the southern states in 
the nations interior 
roubik said that the africanized bees may need tropical flowers 
and nestuilding materials and this could stop them from getting 
established in colder parts of the united states 
david jc fletcher of bucknell university said in a report that 
bees in africa are more gentle make more honey and are easier to 
control than their africanized descendents in the americas he 
proposed bringing friendly bees from africa to the united states 
and letting them breed with the killer bees so they will pass on 
their desirable traits 
however it is currently illegal to bring live honeybees into 
the united states efforts to crossbreed killer bees with european 
honeybees have proven unsuccessful because the africanized bees are 
genetically dominant

dennis clouthier is a conservative 
republican prostar wars procontra aid and opposed to the 
ussoviet nuclear arms treaty yet in 1986 he voted for a 
liberal democrat for governor solely because the gop incumbent 
championed the seabrook nuclear power plant 
the stalled 52 billion project on new hampshires seacoast 
has been a leading state and regional issue throughout much of its 
16year history now its foes hope voters like clouthier will make 
it an influential factor in the first presidential primary of the 
1988 season possibly ruining the presidential bid of vice 
president george bush 
all seven major democratic presidential candidates are to some 
extent opposed to seabrook with massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
playing a key role in blocking a license for the completed reactor 
but there are some sharp distinctions among the five republican 
aspirants 
seabrook opponents criticize pronuclear republicans at the 
bottom of the polls former delaware gov pete du pont and former 
television evangelist pat robertson but their chief target is 
bush whose frontrunner status in new hampshire polls has been 
jeopardized by his thirdplace showing in the iowa caucuses 
bush views on seabrook have echoed those of his state campaign 
chairman gov john sununu its fate should be left to the nuclear 
regulatory commission not state governors 
george bush is going to do terribly on the seacoast among 
republicans because of seabrook and it could end up costing him 
the presidency said kurt ehrenberg of search 88 he noted that 
a littleknown antiseabrook challenger to sununu in the 1986 
gubernatorial primary won 22 percent of the vote statewide and up 
to 45 percent in some seacoast towns 
to try to help fulfill that prophecy ehrenbergs group last 
week began airing radio ad on seacoast stations that concluded 
if you dont want seabrook you dont want george bush 
bush campaign aide andrew card disputed ehrenbergs prediction 
i dont think voters are that parochial card said it 
will be an issue but one of many many issues in the primary not 
a cutting issue 
electing a governor and electing a president are two different 
things said paul young of new york rep jack kemps campaign 
but he also speculated that seabrook could have an impact if it 
costs bush support on the seacoast 
kemp a strong proponent of states rights has asked federal 
regulators to hold up a lowpower license for seabrook before 
evacuation plans are developed that win the confidence of people 
within the plants 10mile emergency planning zone 
i want to make clear he is not against nuclear power just 
for the health and safety of the people young said 
however the kemp camp has not been trumpeting its positions on 
seabrook 
i understand that thats politics said mimi fallon of the 
group republicans against seabrook station theyre afraid 
theyre going to lose the people they already have on the other 
side who support the plant said fallon who supports kemp 
another republican hopeful sen bob dole of kansas has 
suggested that the nonpartisan national academy of sciences review 
seabrooks evacuation plans because of a perception that the nrc 
favors the industry it is supposed to regulate in december dole 
also asked the nrc to hold up lowpower testing until evacuation 
issues are settled 
id like to see senator dole go a little further but im not 
knocking what hes done ehrenberg said hes a tough guy to 
move on some issues thats clear hes a very careful politician 
what irks the antiseabrook activists is doles insistence that 
governors should not have veto power over nuclear plants but in an 
interview this month dole also said a governor has got to be 
certain that the rights of his people are protected 
on the democratic side dukakis is fighting in federal court 
against an nrc rule change that would allow approval of evacuation 
plans developed by utilities when governments balk dukakis tried 
to reinforce his standing with antiseabrook voters last week by 
holding a news conference with the reactor in the background 
ehrenberg speculated that dukakis action against seabrook may 
have gained him some early organizational support in neighboring 
new hampshire but that hasnt stopped the other democrats from 
wooing the antiseabrook vote in some cases in spite of 
generally pronuclear records 
former arizona gov bruce babbitt said he served on the 
presidential commission that investigated the 1979 three mile 
island accident and recommended the evacuationplanning rules that 
have become seabrooks major obstacle 
former colorado sen gary hart said he sat on a congressional 
panel that helped write those recommendations law 
jesse jackson favors a rapid phaseout of all the nations 
nuclear power plants and notes that he opposed seabrook in his 1984 
preidential campaign before the chernobyl disaster in the soviet 
union 
sen paul simon of illinois calls seabrook a white elephant 
that should not operate and he held a news conference last week in 
the same place dukakis did to criticize pronuclear votes by rep 
richard gephardt of missouri 
simon noted that a nuclear industry lobbying group said last 
year that gephardt voted with the industry 53 percent of the time 
in recent years but gephardt says his votes came under a more 
vigilant nrc and he has learned since chernobyl 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee voted with the nuclear 
industry 55 percent of the time when he was in the house but has 
taken a lowkey position on problems at the tennessee valley 
authority nuclear reactors 
clouthier the new hampshire voter who is a qualitycontrol 
manager said he doesnt see seabrook as an overriding issue in the 
primary 
but i think theyre all avoiding it like a hot potato because 
it is so controversial clouthier said

city park in new orleans is a marvelous place 
its museum of art friday framed a new face 
not a mondrian modern or unknown jurassic 
not van gogh or matisse or some other old classic 
they brought this seuss fellow fresh from the west coast 
to personally bring what he does the most 
to a place which has showcased peruvian gold 
king tut and old glass twas a stroke the most bold 
theyve brought cats with tall hats creatures so long and 
slinky 
and how did he draw them with eyes that go winky 
they invited as well just to welcome him there 
a few fellow artists oh heavens beware 
reporters cartoonists writers art critics 
will they be converted perhaps catalytic 
all joined in big easy at carnival time 
to welcome the master of nonsense and rhyme 
dr seuss is the fellow we know him as ted 
geisels the last name stick that in your head 
it seemed such a good scheme when the directors thought it 
that no one not even the ombudsmen fought it 
they wanted something classy to put on a show 
and so they went shopping in san diego 
what they got were some prints some old manuscripts too 
to put up on the walls in red yellow and blue 
the old master walked in looking fit and welltanned 
and saw that the media there was wellmanned 
so he pitched out some quotes which they all gobbled up 
from the floor where they fell like fatbellied pups 
asked what children might gain if they see dr seuss 
the sage quickly replied well what will they lose 
then he chuckled and said trying hard not to pun 
why my only hope is theyll have them some fun 
kids sometimes come to museums escorting mommies and daddies 
and wait holding thick fingers wishing for peppermint patties 
but heres an exhibit that all can admire 
there are creepies and crawlies and creative fire 
dont worry bout this dont worry bout that 
said seuss this is stuff just to be looked at 
the doors will be open until april 10 
so get yourself down here and walk yourself in 
and if youre afraid of an encounter with culture 
why youre in new orleans just mask as a vulture 
oh yes all the journalists cynical tired 
after seeing the doctor they all left inspired

customers at the waycross newsstand usually 
discuss politics football and current events over coffee but 
lately talk has focused on charges of discrimination against blacks 
in the mostly white ware county school system 
newsstand owner jack perry said the complaints stem from 
isolated incidents and are not a sign of serious racial 
problems in the county 
i think we have a fine racial situation said perry 59 
whose family has lived in this southeast georgia town of 19500 for 
75 years there are some isolated incidents but we make an 
effort to resolve our differences 
around the corner from the newsstand is the office of huey 
spearman attorney for the waycross branch of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
spearman disagrees with perrys assessment he says three recent 
incidents demonstrate a pattern of discrimination that is condoned 
by school officials 
ten black students say a white school bus driver forced them to 
sit in the back of a bus after they missed school on martin luther 
king day last month 
the bus driver dale dixon wrote a letter to school officials 
and passengers saying she seated the black students at the rear to 
facilitate loading and unloading 
in another incident spearman said school officials failed to 
discipline two white ware county high school cheerleaders who 
blackened their faces at a pep rally and posed as clumsy football 
players from predominantly black waycross high 
black leaders also have charged that until black parents 
complained school officials failed to discipline white students 
who wore ku klux klanstyle hoods at a toga party 
i think were seeing vestiges of the 60s spearman said 
noting that the county school system is 4 percent black while the 
city school system is 65 percent black 
i think it probably goes back to the days when the schools 
were segregated he said a lot of people moved into the county 
so they would not have to integrate i think the white parents as 
well as the school administration would like to keep it white 
last week he gave the school board a list of steps the naacp 
felt were necessary they included the dismissal of the bus driver 
disciplinary action against school officials for improper handling 
of the incidents and a public apology to black students barred from 
county school buses for refusing to sit in the back for a second 
day 
were going to try hard to do whats right said donnie 
griffin chairman of the ware county board of education 
on friday the board refused to act against the bus driver but 
agreed to erase suspensions from the records of three black girls 
who refused to obey her order 
griffin a pharmacist said he thought ware county had been 
blessed with good race relations and he was surprised when the 
controversy surfaced 
for the most part i think we get along very well he said 
we have a great community we want to work to make this community 
even better 
my number one concern is to let everyone know there will be no 
discrimination whether by race or income or handicap weve got a 
good board and were going to do what it takes to keep it a good 
system 
after black teenagers and their parents testified about the 
three incidents at a board meeting tuesday night at least two 
black students got menacing phone calls spearman said 
he said consolidation of the city and county school systems 
should be the ultimate goal but that merger is not likely any time 
soon because many whites still cling to old racist attitudes 
i think the people in the county would fight it vigorously 
said spearman adding that he believes the reagan administration 
has contributed to racial problems by failing to take a strong 
stand on civil rights 
supremacists seem to be on the rise again he said

cultural differences and national pride 
distinguish russian from estonian and divide parent from child in 
estonia home of a small ethnic group caught between stronger 
neighbors for centuries 
dissidents plan protests feb 16 in lithuania and feb 24 in 
estonia to mark the days when the baltic republics declared their 
independence from soviet russia months after the bolshevik 
revolution of 1917 
last august in an event dissidents say showed the authorities 
they had lost control thousands of people marked the anniversary 
of a secret agreement between nazi germany and the soviet union 
that led to the 1940 soviet takeover of estonia latvia and 
lithuania 
soviet authorities now are encouraging the republics growing 
nonbaltic populations to learn the native language and in some 
cases are seeking to restrict immigration from other parts of the 
soviet union 
people of the baltic nations very different ethnically from the 
soviet unions dominant slavic population always have maintained a 
strong cultural and ethnic identity 
one of the estonian dissidents is 21yearold tina hallik 
daughter of faithful communist party members 
people think if im free if im not in prison or slave labor 
camp then maybe i can do a little something but nothing is 
getting done nothing changes said ms hallik 
the dissidents are seeking permission for a demonstration in the 
center of tallinn capital of estonia on feb 24 they have not 
yet heard from officials but say they have the support of average 
estonians 
if they try to isolate every one of the group the people 
will come out because they will have heard something is 
happening she said 
on thursday ms halliks 55yearold mother klara was among 
writers scholars and officials from the baltic republics taking 
part in a panel discussion of national problems organized for 
foreign reporters by the government news agency novosti 
klara hallik discounted the importance of nationalism as a 
problem in estonia and she and other panel members drew a 
distinction between nationalism and cultural differences 
her daughter said she respects her mothers views but that they 
sharply disagree superiors at work and the kgb have put pressure 
on her parents because of their daughters views ms hallik said 
little open conflict is evident between ethnic groups in 
estonia writer ulo tuulik a member of the officially sponsored 
panel said estonians and other ethnic groups could be compared 
to the mississippi and volga rivers we just live our own lives and 
dont have great conflicts 
estonians number just more than 1 million and make up 61 percent 
of their small republic but that figure has dropped from almost 75 
percent in 1959 russians now make up 28 percent of the population 
according to 1987 official statistics only 25 percent of the 
estonians spoke fluent russian the dominant language of the soviet 
union one out of 10 nonestonians could speak fluent estonian 
in latvia in 1979 there were about 13 million latvians and 
821000 russians but lithuanians made up 80 percent of the 
population of their republic 
the official group blamed nationalist protests on a small group 
of extremists 
toomas karjaharm a professor of history at tallinn state 
conservatory said the protests are tied to social and economic 
problems which have gotten worse in the past few years and which 
officials are trying to solve under mikhail s gorbachevs reform 
policies 
officials say the number of estonians in the republic is 
dropping because estonians have one of the lowest birth rates in 
the soviet union and that many of the nonestonians who move there 
are young people attracted by good jobs in the republics 
industries 
but one estonian dissident speaking on condition of anonymity 
dismissed gorbachev as a loud voice of an empty barrel rolling 
along 
to limit the migration officials are requiring staterun 
industries that seek workers outside the republic to put up about 
25000 for each workers housing a similar program is in effect 
in latvia 
officials also are trying to publish more books in the native 
languages of the baltic republics and are encouraging people of 
nonbaltic origin to learn the languages of the indigenous 
nationalities 
the official media also accuse western radio stations of 
stirring up nationalist feelings in the baltics 
most of the protests in the baltic republics have been peaceful 
but the dissidents report more surveillance and pressure 
dissident sources say activists in lithuania and estonia have 
been arrested for refusing temporary military service they charge 
that the temporary callup in both cases was an attempt by 
authorities to discourage protests 
the official lithuanian press has warned that activists face 
prosecution if they disrupt public order and soviet president 
andrei a gromyko addressed the issue in a visit to vilnius 
lithuania a week ago 
two members of a group trying to establish an alternative to the 
communist party in estonia vello vaartnou and ekepart nomm said 
they were forced to emigrate saturday to sweden 
the baltic helsinki group a human rights group based in 
stockholm sweden quoted nomm as saying he and vaartnou had been 
told by soviet authorities to leave the country or face 
imprisonment

agreed to erase suspensions from the records of three black girls 
who refused to obey her order 
griffin a pharmacist said he thought ware county had been 
blessed with good race relations and he was surprised when the 
controversy surfaced 
for the most part i think we get along very well he said 
we have a great community we want to work to make this community 
even better 
my number one concern is to let everyone know there will be no 
discrimination whether by race or income or handicap weve got a 
good board and were going to do what it takes to keep it a good 
system 
after black teenagers and their parents testified about the 
three incidents at a board meeting tuesday night at least two 
black students got menacing phone calls spearman said 
he said consolidation of the city and county school systems 
should be the ultimate goal but that merger is not likely any time 
soon because many whites still cling to old racist attitudes 
i think the people in the county would fight it vigorously 
said spearman adding that he believes the reagan administration 
has contributed to racial problems by failing to take a strong 
stand on civil rights 
supremacists seem to be on the rise again he said

its not safe to be mayor in this western 
nebraska community of 10000 there have been three of them in 37 
days and two of them were recalled 
this office is scared im scared i dont know if this stuff 
is going to die said kevin horn executive director of the 
chamber of commerce 
horn and other community leaders are worried about the citys 
image and how it will attract new residents and businesses 
i was 100 150 miles from home and people would laugh heres 
the alliance guy whats going on up there said hal murray a 
liquor salesman who was an organizer of the first recall drive 
antidrug crusader dick zellaha was ousted as mayor in that 
recall on dec 15 and his successor rival duane worley was 
officially recalled jan 20 
car salesman richard robb appointed to the city council in 
october to fill a vacancy is the latest to hold the title of 
mayor a ceremonial job that pays only 575 a year 
the mayor serves as president of the city council while city 
manager wolfgang bauer runs the towns daytoday business 
i think the key word for alliance at this point is 
polarized said horn who was warned before moving to alliance 
to take the chamber job that this was a community that would 
fight 
since omaha mayor mike boyle was recalled in january 1987 the 
state has seen a big increase in recall elections of mayors city 
councilmen school board members and other elected officials the 
omaha recall was considered a trigger to many of the other recalls 
all in small communities 
according to a study by a legislative committee there were 11 
recall elections in the state from 1984 through 1986 in 1987 
there were 17 
the nebraska legislature is considering a bill that would make 
it tougher to recall an elected official the bill would require 
petition groups to state reasons for the recall and the reasons 
would have to be more serious than mere disagreement with the 
officials voting record 
at the center of the alliance controversy is zellaha 49 a 
former department store manager and onetime amateur boxer who 
called himself the great lakes mauler 
zellaha who is unemployed but supports himself with investments 
and his wifes salary believes he was recalled because people were 
jealous of the attention his antidrug campaign received including 
a letter from first lady nancy reagan 
his opponents said the problem was much deeper they accused him 
of unethically and illegally using his office to promote his 
personal gain 
council members elected zellaha mayor in december 1986 and one 
month later his son was seriously injured in a traffic accident 
shane zellaha now 25 owned up to a drug problem and father and 
son began giving talks on drug abuse 
critics said zellaha wasnt able to separate his personal 
campaign from his responsibilities as mayor the recall committee 
also accused him of harassing the police department shouting at 
meetings misusing city stationery and postage and bringing 
ridicule to the city 
asked if he did anything in office that was illegal or 
unethical he replied oh heavens no heavens no i never did 
worley and council member wendy fierstein were recalled for 
allegedly not honoring a groups request that electrical rates be 
lowered and that the city manager be fired 
worley said bauer had done nothing to warrant firing he also 
said the city was working to adjust the electrical rates 
worley whose recall was the work of another committee said he 
is disturbed by the publicity the recalls have created 
the acting mayors council seat and three others are up for 
election this year with the primary on may 10 robb wont say if 
hell run zellaha has promised his wife he wont run but their son 
is a candidate 
this would have been a good place to do two things a study on 
government and another one on psychology said bauer how 
the psychology of this whole thing worked and how it transpired 
and what the emotions were and how ugly it got

a smoldering shell was all that remained 
saturday of the former high school for the performing arts which 
helped launch the careers of future stars and inspired the movie 
and tv series fame

fame although the board of education did not permit film crews 
to shoot scenes inside the facade was featured in the 1980 film

reputation said dancer paula brown who appeared in the series

working on fame was like being in school i was 22 years old 
and i felt like i was 15 starting all over again said ms

republican presidential hopeful jack 
kemp predicted saturday he will beat pat robertson in new 
hampshires primary and aired a new television commercial targeting 
rivals bob dole and george bush 
kemps 30second spot says vice president bush and senate gop 
leader dole have not done enough to help the contra rebels fighting 
the leftist nicaraguan government 
it did not mention robertson the former television evangelist 
whom kemp is battling for conservative support in the primary on 
tuesday 
were not that worried about robertson kemp press secretary 
john buckley said after the new york congressman held a news 
conference to unveil the ad 
but after finishing a distant fourth in mondays iowa caucuses 
while robertson placed second behind dole and ahead of bush 
kemps white house bid hinges on at least a thirdplace finish in 
new hampshire preferably ahead of robertson 
asked if his campaign would be dead if robertson beats him 
tuesday kemp said hes not going to beat me in new hampshire 
however a poll conducted thursday and friday nights in new 
hampshire and published saturday in the boston globe indicated that 
roberston is in third place with 11 percent while kemp had 8 
percent although the difference was half the samples margin of 
error 
buckley said kemp would air two more new ads as the new 
hampshire campaign wound down but neither would criticize any of 
the other candidates 
the spot focusing on contra aid opens with a picture of bush 
presiding over the senate a male voice saying president 
reagans request for aid to the freedom fighters narrowly loses 
when eight republicans who endorsed george bush desert the 
president 
the spot continues communist dictator nicaraguan leader 
daniel ortega continues his military buildup yet bob dole told 
the boston globe he wasnt concerned about ortega or his army is 
that leadership 
contra leader adolfo calero said jack kemp is the only one 
who lifted a finger to help us thats leadership 
kemp acknowledged that dole voted for contra aid but said he 
didnt lift a finger according to adolfo calero to get more 
money last summer 
buckley later added sure dole has voted in the right place 
but this guy has run for the last year on leadership and the 
question that were raising here is whether or not hes really 
truly had the leadership hes claimed to have had to have gotten 
more aid to the contras

danny and the juniors must have had the gift of 
prophecy when they recorded rock and roll is here to stay 30 
years ago 
the number of radio stations nationwide playing rock music of 
the late 1950s the 1960s and 1970s has doubled in the last five 
years and the trend is continuing according to the authoritative 
broadcastingcablecasting yearbook 
for 1981 the yearbook listed 232 am or fm radio stations 
playing the gamut of popular music of past decades oldies 
golden oldies nostalgia classic rock old gold solid gold and 
classic rock 
that number had grown to 464 by 1986 and members of the 
yearbook staff at the main office of broadcasting magazine in 
washington said recently the 1988 yearbook will list 537 of the 
countrys 10219 stations as playing oldies 
there are indications most are doing well in a highly 
competitive business 
figures at arbitron ratings the service that keeps tabs on the 
nations listening habits show that in many large markets oldies 
stations are among the top 10 draws 
there is no clearcut explanation for classic rocks popularity 
but many in the industry believe millions of baby boomers prefer 
the music they grew up with 
i think it really comes down to the music said wods program 
director dave vandyke whose boston station went on air last 
october with its oldies format for the adults of today the 
music thats being released just doesnt do a thing for them but 
teenagers also are desiring this kind of music more than whats 
being recorded today 
in new york joe mccoy program director at wcbsfm said his 
stations oldie format transcended the generations 
this is the stuff parents grew up on this is the stuff they 
were weaned on so theyre translating it to the kids today he 
said in a telephone interview 
in hartford conn where wdrcfm plays solid gold rock n 
roll with emphasis on music between 19641975 the stations 
program director frank holler agreed the oldies had appeal for 
young adults 
but holler himself a baby boomer at 39 was most eloquent when 
describing the meaning of wdrcs music to others of his age 
he spoke on the telephone to a background of peter and gordons 
world without love 
the people love it it reminds them of a very special time of 
their lives said holler of his stations music there is a 
familiarity that both men and women are immediately comfortable 
with and it has not been played to such excess within the last 15 
years as to be burned out 
i think as long as the baby boom generation is alive with 
disposable income that the advertisers are looking to reach the 
music of the 50s 60s and 70s is going to continue to be 
popular he said 
garry guthrie whose edinborough rand inc advises stations on 
formats agreed that there is considerable advertiser interest 
in baby boomers 
most of them are in the 35000plus range he said in a 
telephone interview from scottsdale ariz you are giving 
advertisers a large block of people with discretionary income who 
want to be on top of trends who are willing to buy durable goods 
guthrie said he has overseen about 12 station changes to classic 
rock formats since he set up business in october 1985 and we 
have yet to have any failures

the president of italy on saturday rejected the 
resignation of giovanni goria and told him to stay on as premier to 
get the countrys 1988 budget approved 
president francesco cossiga summoned the christian democrat 
politician to the presidential palace to inform him of his decision 
a statement from the presidential palace said goria was asked to 
return because his presence was an absolute necessity to pass the 
national budget the deadline for parliamentary approval of the 
budget is april 30 
goria said in a statement that he accepted the decision because 
he understood the difficulties of the moment and the call to a 
sense of responsibility that everyone of us must have 
gorias resignation wednesday marked the second time he had done 
so since november when he resigned last week he cited factional 
fighting within his own christian democrat party and accused party 
dissidents of demonstrating a lack of responsibility 
he met later saturday night with senate president giovanni 
spadolini and nilde iotti the communist speaker of the chamber of 
deputies to tell them cossigas decision 
just before he met iotti one italian jounalist told him 
welcome back goria quipped never left 
cossigas other options included appointing a new 
premierdesignate to try to form a new coalition government or 
dissolving parliament and calling early general elections 
goria at 44 is italys youngest ever premier he resigned 
after a series of defeats on secret votes on the budget convinced 
him he could no longer govern at the time cossiga asked him to 
remain in a caretaker capacity until the decision on a new 
government could be made 
while cossigas decision at least temporarily resurrects italys 
47th postwar government it does not resolve the problems within 
the governing coalition that led to the collapse 
even before the decision was announced gorias reappointment 
for the approval of the budget had emerged as the principal 
shortterm solution 
this would allow us to move on to the next phase in a less 
convulsive way said arnaldo forlani a top christian democrat 
cossiga opted to reject gorias resignation after consultations 
with leaders of the five parties in the coalition only the 
opposition communist party sharply opposed the idea to reinstate 
him 
the plan was supported by gorias dominant christian democrats 
and the socialists the second largest party in the coalition 
which also included republicans social democrats and liberals 
in fact the socialists have warned that unless goria was 
reappointed the country might be forced to hold early elections 
goria took office 6 months ago but from the start his ability 
to hold the fragile coalition together has been in doubt 
he resigned once before in november in a budget dispute with 
the tiny liberal party but he was convinced by cossiga to withdraw 
his resignation and continue as premier 
gorias recent losses in the secret votes in the chamber of 
deputies the lower house of parliament were due in part to 
factional fighting within his own party 
analysts suggest some christian democrats are trying to 
undermine goria to make party secretary ciriaco de mita the prime 
minister 
the leadership of the longdominant party is considered by many 
the most powerful post in italy and some party insiders would like 
to move de mita out of the post at the party congress in april by 
making him premier 
other members of the party reportedly have voted against goria 
secretly because they want to give foreign minister giulio 
andreotti the premiership for a sixth time

advocates for the homeless bore the plain 
wooden caskets of a man and woman to a pennsylvania avenue plaza 
across from city hall on saturday and prayed for a world where 
people do not die in the cold 
bundled against subfreezing temperatures and a bitter wind 
about 40 activists conducted a funeral service dubbed tasteless 
by city officials a day after the authorities lost a legal fight 
for custody of the corpses 
mitch snyder leader of the community for creative nonviolence 
said the public service prior to cremation of the bodies was 
designed to call attention to the deaths of 10 homeless people this 
winter on the streets of the capital the city says 13 people have 
died of hypothermia seven of them homeless 
snyders group said prayers for henry dixon found dead of 
hypothermia jan 2 at a parking attendants booth three blocks from 
the funeral site and for an unidentified woman who died jan 7 
the rev william wendt holding his left hand on the casket of 
the woman called jane doe read the names of the dead as those 
surrounding him cried out forgive us after each name 
let us pray for ourselves who are tested by their deaths 
wendt said may god grant us and others too new courage to face 
life and do something about it this world should be a place 
where people have a home and do not die in the cold 
ccnv says it has picked up from the city morgue the remains of 
about 40 people in the last eight years who have died of 
hypothermia and whose families have not come forward to claim the 
bodies the city had agreed in the past to turn the bodies over to 
ccnv in the groups capacity as a friend of the homeless the 
group has preserved the ashes of each victim 
jerome woods director the department of human services ordered 
the two bodies held this week however citing a city law that 
allows the government to withhold the remains if they are to be 
used in a tasteless way 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson ordered the bodies 
released friday saying ccnvs plans for a service on pennsylvania 
avenue were no different in principle than the public funeral 
corteges of president kennedy and the rev martin luther king jr 
i cant believe we had a tugofwar over this said snyder 
wrapped in a blanket against the cold winds the city doesnt 
care about these people when theyre alive and all of a sudden 
they care when theyre dead 
ccnv members said the city has ignored a city law passed last 
month requiring public buildings to be opened to the homeless when 
the temperature falls below 25 degrees 
city officials countered that an elementary school was opened to 
the homeless but wasnt fully utilized by them

three suspects were in jail and president 
amin gemayel resumed his travels saturday one day after avoiding 
an assassination attempt when a bomb was found planted in his 
jetliner 
a police spokesman identified the suspects only as lebanese 
airport employees and said they were being held in solitary 
confinement pending completion of an investigation 
a 1pound charge of tnt found under a pilots seat of the middle 
east airlines boeing 707 jetline that was to leave for larnaca 
cyprus on friday to carry gemayel to sana north yemen the bomb 
was defused by explosives experts at beirut airport 
gemayel was assigned another aircraft and arrived saturday in 
north yemen where he was greeted by north yemeni leader col ali 
abdullah saleh the two presidents are to discuss lebanon and other 
arab issues 
gemayel 44 usually travels by military helicopter from the 
christian heartland northeast of beirut to larnaca and flies from 
there to world capitals 
the maronite catholic has not used beirut airport in the citys 
moslem sector since 1984 when moslem and leftist militias wrested 
control of west beirut from the regular lebanese army 
beirut airport surrounded by shiite moslem slums is controlled 
by syrian troops who were deployed in the capitals western sector 
almost a year ago in an effort to end three years of militia 
anarchy 
the police spokesman said the explosive charge was equipped with 
a sophisticated pressure fuse that would have detonated it when the 
plane reached an altitude of 30000 feet 
it was obviously an attempt to kill the president the 
spokesman added 
lebanon has been plagued by assassinations car bombings and 
kidnappings since its moslemchristian civil war broke out in 1975 
the conflict has claimed more than 130000 lives

reading writing and arithmetic will join politics 
this week as communist party leaders meet to reform the countrys 
vast public education system and clarify the futures of two fallen 
proteges of mikhail s gorbachev 
the 300plusmember party central committee will convene in 
plenary session at a time when as the soviet magazine new times 
recently put it everyone seems dissatisfied with the present 
education system 
gorbachev the partys general secretary since march 1985 has 
repeatedly urged improvements in education as part of his drive for 
perestroika or restructuring of society 
education the 56yearold soviet leader has said is key to 
improving soviet technology and management and to making the 
country more competitive on world markets 
changes made by the central committee in the countrys public 
education apparatus could have sweeping consequences for a large 
part of the soviet populationthere are 40 million students and 3 
million teachers in the soviet union the official tass news agency 
reported recently 
the date of the central committee meeting has not been 
officially announced but foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov said it would be held sometime this week 
the ruling politburo which directs the partys work between 
plenary sessions of the central committee discussed education at a 
closeddoor meeting on feb 4 but no details have been released 
the central committee is officially the partys policymaking 
body and is composed of top national officials local party bosses 
and communists from the armed forces government ministries 
industry and agriculture 
by party rules it is the sole body empowered to make changes in 
the politburo and this weeks session could see some changes in 
the ruling 13member body 
at the central committees last plenum on oct 21 gorbachev 
protege boris n yeltsin strongly criticized style of leadership 
and said the pace of reform was too slow yeltsin 57 was removed 
as moscow party leader on nov 11 a week later he was given 
another job first deputy director of the state construction 
committee which made him a government official with the rank of 
minister 
yeltsin was stripped of two lesser positions in the moscow city 
government on nov 14 recent press articles have mentioned him 
without referring to his position as a nonvoting politburo member 
this could indicate the central committee will formally strip 
yeltsin of his politburo post 
another fallen gorbachev ally and candidate politburo member 
nikolai v talyzin is also in the spotlight talyzin 59 was made 
head of the state planning committee in october 1985 but last 
june gorbachev criticized him by name 
the next blow came feb 6 when tass announced that talyzin had 
been relieved of his planning job and made chairman of the obscure 
social development bureau the central committee now may sack 
talyzin from his nonvoting post on the politburo 
the committee could name immediate replacements for yeltsin and 
talyzin and add another voting politburo member 
at its october session the committee dropped politburo member 
geidar a aliev 54 who oversaw light industry and public 
transport and was the last man to rise to the ruling body under the 
patronage of president leonid i brezhnev 
aside from personnel changes the central committee may set the 
agenda for the first nationwide conference of local communist party 
leaders to be held since the stalin era gorbachev has said the 
topics of the conference to be held in june will include 
electoral and judicial reforms 
the last party conference was held in february 1941 a party 
conference can be held between party congresses which take place 
every five years and western observers believe gorbachev will use 
the occasion to put his stamp even more firmly on the partys top 
bureaus 
from a western perspective soviet education appears extremely 
rigid with the curriculum for the countrys schools set by a 
central ministry in moscow and little variation allowed at local 
schools in the classroom pupils are taught largely by the rote 
method and conformity is stressed 
they are discouraged from studying independently educating 
themselves and developing selfreliance new times quoted soviet 
educator victor tomashkevich as saying 
in the past soviet officials stressed the nations 99 percent 
literacy rate and the states payment of all education costs for 
citizens soviet education in the basic sciences and mathematics is 
regarded in the west as strong 
it is not known exactly what changes the central committee might 
make in the educational system but some of the ideas that have 
been floated in the press include more flexibility in determining 
the curricula and teaching method at the local level increasing 
teachers salaries and reducing class size 
one key to the countrys technological advancement computer 
training has already been made part of the basic education 
program but computers and qualified teachers are scarce soviet 
officials acknowledge 
the central committee also could mandate changes in the academy 
of pedagogical sciences which is in charge of training teachers 
the youth newspape komsomolskaya pravda lashed out at the 
academy on feb 2 saying it has turned into social security for 
retired ministers directors and other nonfunctioning 
functionaries of education

the weekend takeover of a university of 
massachusetts building by black students protesting campus racism 
is the latest in a series of incidents at the school in recent 
years 
minority students say school administrators have contributed to 
the problem by being insensitive to their concerns and by moving 
slowly in implementing recommendations made in a stinging 1987 
report that said the school has acted superficially and 
sporadically to deal with racism 
the mostpublicized incident on campus was a fight between white 
and black students following the new york mets victory over the 
boston red sox in the final game of the 1986 world series 
in 1984 a black umass senior who was arrested and jailed for 
two days before being cleared of setting a string of campus fires 
complained that her arrest was motivated by impermissible racial 
considerations 
last year the university disciplined six white students who 
admitted chasing and beating a black student after the world series 
game they pleaded no contest to assault charges 
it was the report ordered after that incident that lambasted 
umass for not intervening to stem an apparent surge in racial 
tensions 
the administrations historical denial of racial problems 
caused not only the failure to predict and prevent the incident 
but also caused black student faculty and staff discontent with 
its conduct of the subsequent investigation a discontent which was 
exacerbated by a perception that the quality of campus life for 
minorities at umass is generally declining the report said 
it called for the hiring more minority faculty and 
administrators and urged antiracism education for administrators 
blacks constitute 7 percent of the schools 18000 undergraduates 
and only 38 of 1464 umass professors are black 
umass officials vowed when the report was released five months 
ago to work harder to improve race relations on campus but 
students interviewed in the past week following two recent 
incidents say little has changed 
racism comes from inside said matt bigg black affairs 
editor at a student newspaper i cant express how much it hurts 
when a person hates you for something you cant help being its a 
dull pain that never goes away

republican presidential candiate pat 
robertson has canceled interviews and ducked questions when asked 
to back up anecdotes hes told including one about a woman who 
caught aids by kissing her impotent husband a newspaper reported 
saturday 
the concord monitor said the former television evangelist also 
has failed to document assertions he knows a little girl in 
pittsburgh whose reading level soared from second to seventh grade 
in 20 days under a moneysaving program to improve reading skills 
the newspaper said it has asked robertson and his staff for 
documentation but details have not been produced and interviews 
have been canceled 
the newspaper said it asked for details after an aids expert 
concerned with robertsons remarks said acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome is spread through sex blood or needles and mother to 
infant 
robertson said saturday the story about the woman catching aids 
was a news story gathered by our news department 
it was strictly off the wire reports but was gathered when we 
did a series on my television program dealing with this subject 
robertson said 
robertsons staff has not identified the girl whom the candidate 
has cited as an example of an inexpensive method of improving 
childrens reading skills the monitor said 
all of the stories are verifiable robertson said we gave 
them the names of who to check every one of them is true 
three weeks ago the monitor asked for documentation of the 
aids case the account of the little girl and two other anecdotes 
robertson has used in interviews the newspaper said 
aides offered names of people they believed could substantiate 
two of the anecdotes at best their comments offered partial 
support in the other two instances the staff provided no 
documentation and people contacted by the monitor said the stories 
were unlikely 
initially staff members said they would respond to the 
monitors request for documentation last week they recommended 
asking robertson himself campaign aides arranged two interviews 
this week both were canceled 
stopped in an elevator in the statehouse on thursday 
robertson said i havent got time for that really thats 
background 
robertson missed a third interview by telephone arranged by 
his staff for later thursday night the newspaper said 
the newspaper said that friday marc nuttle robertsons 
campaign manager said the examples were taken from segments of the 
700 club a program on robertsons christian broadcasting network 
but he did not know how producers who worked on the stories could 
be reached 
regarding aids by a kiss the monitor quoted robertson at from a 
december news conference i know one man who was impotent who 
gave aids to his wife and the only thing they did was kiss 
in an earlier interview with the monitor robertson said that 
if a person is in a room with 25 people with aids and theyre 
breathing various things into the atmosphere the chance of 
somebody catching it has become quite strong the newspaper 
said 
the monitor said scott hatch a spokesman for robertson said 
that information was taken from a british medical report which 
he said he sent to the monitor by overnight mail about a week ago 
it did not arrive

president kurt waldheim was quoted sunday 
as saying he will not resign because a great and silent 
majority supports him despite the furor over his world war ii 
conduct 
i feel the group who makes the demand that i should resign is 
relatively small compared to those who want me to stay in office 
the president said in an interview published in the tabloid kurier 
on saturday chancellor franz vranitzky launched his harshest 
criticism yet of waldheim when he said that mere noninvolvement in 
war crimes did not qualify one to be president of austria 
a top government official disclosed meanwhile that a majority in 
the socialist party which is governing austria with waldheims 
conservative backers wants the president to resign 
vranitzky a socialist and head of government spoke in a radio 
interview about waldheim whose duties as head of state are mostly 
ceremonial he criticized the presidents conduct throughout the 
international debate about his wartime past 
without mentioning names vranitzky berated waldheim and his 
conservative backers for accepting word from six military 
historians who said they found no evidence waldheim was involved in 
war crimes but dismissing the rest of their report 
the 202page document presented on monday established 
waldheims close proximity to wartime atrocities in the balkans 
and seriously questioned his moral integrity as a german army 
officer during world war ii 
last year the us justice department barred waldheim from the 
country as an undesirable alien and said his unit sent thousands of 
jews to nazi death camps 
vranitzky told austrian radio after all nobody has ever 
conducted an election campaign by saying please vote for me 
because i am not a war criminal 
the federal president will certainly continue to be confronted 
with a series of questions and will have to face up to them 
in the kurier interview waldheim said i do not at all share 
the opinion of the historians commission that he had kept silent 
about or belittled his wartime activities 
i was also of the opinion that it did not belong in the 
framework of this task of the commission to make such assumptions 
and interpretations 
after all the surveys i am rather convinced that the great 
majority which is very often the silent one wants me to stay 
on he was quoted as saying 
waldheim was in innsbruck saturday with jordanian king hussein 
and queen noor in his first public appearance since the 
commissions report was released 
the president was greeted by about 50 whistling protesters who 
called for his resignation and threw eggs at waiting limousines 
waldheim was scheduled to address the nation in a fiveminute 
television appearance monday night 
in west germany der spiegel magazine said saturday that a 
document linking waldheim to the deportations of thousands of 
civilians during world war ii was a fake and apologized for 
publishing it 
spiegel regrets that it presented this document to its 
readers as the proof of waldheims involvement the magazine 
said in its latest edition 
spiegel said bernhard haas a document expert from stuttgart 
concluded that the military telegram was in all likelihood a 
fake 
the telegram allegedly linked waldheim to the deportation of 
more than 4000 civilians while he served as an officer in the 
german army in yugoslavia in 1942 
the document was not used by the commission investigating the 
president 
heinrich keller a chief secretary in the socialist party 
reported that for the first time a majority of party members want 
waldheim to resign 
keller who was also interviewed by austrian radio said he saw 
a turnaround in rankandfile sentiment in the wake of the 
commissions report 
the socialists are senior partners in the coalition government 
with the conservatives 
at the socialist party congress last october a majority of 198 
delegates voted against a resolution calling for waldheims 
resignation while 101 supported the motion there were 276 
abstentions 
i would believe that such a vote today would have rather the 
reverse outcome keller said

secretary of state ken hechler a 
lifelong bachelor remembers the most successful love letter he 
ever wrote only it was for someone else 
it was during world war ii and one of hechlers army buddies 
was about to lose his girlfriend to another suitor sensing that 
hechler had a way with words the soldier hired him for 1 to 
write a letter to win her back 
i really poured out my heart hechler recalled last week 
i wrote the most persuasive love letter i could dream up i had a 
lot of shakespeare and browning and other literary allusions in 
it 
the soldier more than satisified with the results copied it in 
his own hand and sent it off to his straying girlfriend 
about 10 days later he came up to me very distraught and 
waving the letter from the girl and he said what am i going to do 
now she says shes coming down and wants to get married this 
weekend 
but hechler had a response to that too 
the dollar just covered the letter not the consequences 
hechler said he told his friend

he began studying the oboe when he was 10 years old and at 16 was 
offered a place with the queens hall orchestra by sir henry wood 
by the next year he was principal oboist and had already begun 
to redefine the oboes role as an orchestral instrument 
goossens was part of a family rich in musical talent he is 
survived by his two sisters both harpists marie 93 and sidonie 
87 who was principal harpist with the british broadcastng corp 
symphony orchestra for 50 years 
goossens joined the liverpool orchestra which paid him 22 cents 
a night plus an extra 9 cents for tackling the cor anglais solo in 
rossinis william tell overture 
he played with some of the finest orchestras of the day and by 
1927 after joining sir thomas beecham at the london philharmonic 
he became a soloist 
his playing inspired many original works for the oboe among the 
composers who dedicated works to him were benjamin britten francis 
poulenc and sir edward elgar whose 1934 soliloquy for oboe and 
strings one of his last works was composed in honor of his friend

ever produced said james brown 58 oboist with the english 
chamber orchestra he was a great influence not only on myself 
but on woodwind playing in general 
celebrated clarinetist jack brymer 73 said goossens did more 
for the development of woodwind playing throughout the world than 
any other person when i became a professional musician i became 
friends with him and he was not only a great musician but a 
humorous and pleasant individual 
he opted out of the orchestral world at a fairly early age 
but remained a great soloist almost to the end of his very long 
life

for the first time in nearly three decades the 
name henry maier will be missing from the ballot when milwaukee 
voters choose their mayor 
maier 70 has held the office since 1960 longer than any other 
big city mayor in the country but residents will see fresher faces 
when the city holds its primary vote tuesday 
it has been forgotten that i said the president is too damn 
old to be president at 70 maier said last june when he announced 
he would not seek reelection and i believed that then and i 
believe that now and i think its true of me 
former acting gov martin schreiber and state sen john norquist 
are the leading contenders in the nonpartisan race to fill maiers 
job 
when asked to list his accomplishments maier points to the 
citys revitalized downtown the annual summerfest which the mayor 
once called the super bowl of festivals and a fiscal policy 
that has given milwaukee an aabond rating 
he has cultivated a folksy image with his public singalongs at 
summerfest and other events and the annual christmas tree lighting 
but maier also has a feisty reputation he has been combative 
with the local press has criticized the federal government for 
cutting aid to cities and has blamed suburbs for not sharing their 
wealth and causing many of the citys problems with poverty 
for the average joe in milwaukee he needs a mayor whose 
image is supportive to lean on maier said in a 1983 interview 
he has to feel he has a champion someone who is representing him 
vigorously willing to stand and fight 
but some community leaders say maier has not done enough to help 
the citys black population statistics released last fall by the 
milwaukee urban league show milwaukee is the most segregated major 
metropolitan area in the country and more than 40 percent of the 
citys black children live in poverty 
some black leaders complain that the stability of maiers 28 
years has led to stagnation in addressing inner city issues 
the city hasnt done much with what we wanted said felmers 
chaney president of the milwaukee chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
maybe maier did the best he could i dont know chaney 
said whoever takes his job now needs to come out with a firmer 
stand 
maier however has demonstrated support from blacks and the 
population as a whole 
he repeatedly has dismissed notions of seeking higher office at 
the state capital or in washington

some 1500 women who spent two days discussing 
how they could secure the constitutions blessings of liberty 
were urged to become more active in politics and to run for 
elective office 
it was no accident that the event was sandwiched between last 
weeks iowa presidential caucuses and tuesdays new hampshire 
primary said linda kurtz hallenborg a member of the symposiums 
executive committee 
this is a way to highlight the fact that we need to get more 
women involved in politics she said in an interview friday we 
need to make it clear to the presidential candidates that we make 
up 53 percent of the electorate and womens issues need to be 
taken seriously 
those attending the symposium included us supreme court 
justice sandra day oconnor 1984 vice presidential candidate 
geraldine ferraro coretta scott king widow of slain civil rights 
leader martin luther king jr syndicated newspaper columnist erma 
bombeck and former new york congresswoman bella abzug 
the twoday symposium on women and the constitution at the 
carter presidential center was convened by former first ladies 
rosalynn carter and lady bird johnson 
in speeches and seminars women who attended the event that 
ended friday heard that political power could be their best hope to 
achieve equality in other fields besides politics 
they also heard that the constitution as originally drawn up 
200 years ago deserved criticism as unfair to women and minorities 
our criticism of the unamended constitution is not intended to 
be divisive said mrs king some people apparently feel that 
blacks and women should join in an uncritical celebration of a 
document that protected the slave trade and denied women their 
democratic rights 
sixtyeight years after the ratification of the 19th amendment 
which guaranteed women the right to vote women make up just 14 
percent of the higher statewide political officeholders around the 
country according to the national womens political caucus 
there are 23 women in the us house and two in the senate two 
women are governors of states 
both ms ferraro and mrs king urged women to run for office and 
continue working in other campaigns ms ferraro described a 
ripple effect that she discovered when her 1984 campaign 
generated thousands of letters from women whom her candidacy had 
inspired 
its the young woman writing after the election ive decided 
to go to medical school because of you ms ferraro said its 
the 7yearold writing from her school in minnesota someday im 
going to run for president 
if you dont run you cant win 
while ms ferraro spoke of a future in which women will share 
equally in the political landscape ms hallenborg said the present 
administration and a return to traditionalism by some women has 
slowed down the womens movement 
i think the reagan presidency has been extremely detrimental 
to the progress we have made she said every president up to 
reagan made progress in bringing women into power 
the 1988 elections represent an opportunity for women to 
reassert themselves at the ballot box and the outcome could 
determine whether eight years of republican conservatism has 
splintered the womens equality movement for good ms hallenborg 
said 
this is a clarion call that women need to rise up and be 
counted in the political process she said

two us warships collided with soviet ships in 
the black sea when they violated soviet territorial waters ignored 
warnings from patrol craft and made dangerous maneuvers a 
soviet admiral charged saturday 
the spokesman for the foreign ministry gennady i gerasimov 
called the friday incident off the crimean peninsula an american 
military provocation and likened it to the 1960 downing of a 
u2 spy plane that forced cancellation of a superpower summit 
we hope that this will not hinder the process of improvement 
in sovietamerican relations gerasimov said of the warship 
collisions 
gerasimov and rear adm nikolai p markov appeared at a noon 
news briefing to give the first detailed kremlin version of the 
grazing of the cruiser uss yorktown and the destroyer uss caron by 
two soviet navy vessels 
the soviet defense ministry on friday night accused the american 
vessels of violating soviet waters but did not mention any 
physical contact between them and soviet ships 
us navy officials said the yorktown and the caron were 
deliberately bumped while exercising their right to pass through 
international waters 
but markov and gerasimov told reporters the us warships were 
knowingly violating soviet waters and that the collisions were 
solely the fault of the american captains 
if we look back at history always when there is a tendency 
toward improvement in our relations we see some military 
provocation gerasimov said 
soviet antiaircraft units downed the spy plane piloted by 
francis gary powers on may 1 1960 near sverdlovsk the resulting 
uproar doomed a meeting planned that year between soviet premier 
nikita s khrushchev and president dwight d eisenhower 
gerasimov said us ambassador jack matlock had been summoned to 
the foreign ministry saturday morning where deputy foreign 
minister alexander bessmertnykh read him a strong protest over 
the black sea incident 
the soviet side cannot but view the actions of the united 
states navy as aimed at undermining the process of improvement in 
sovietamerican relations which has appeared recently gerasimov 
said reading from the protest 
unlike the united states which claims a threemile territorial 
limit the soviet union claims a 12mile limit along its coast 
us navy cmdr richard schiff a lawyer said friday in 
washington that any country claiming a 12mile territorial limit 
must allow for innocent passage by the ships of all nations 
but markov and gerasimov said soviet law does not provide for 
the right of innocent passage in black sea waters which the 
soviets have longed claimed as their own 
markov referred repeatedly to dangerous maneuvers by the 
us warships when asked to explain he said the yorktown and 
caron had been warned both before and after entering soviet waters 
he said the two soviet warships identified by pentagon 
officials as a krivakclass frigate and a mirkaclass patrol boat 
were on a basically parallel course with the us vessels when 
the grazings occurred 
the larger krivakclass vessel brushed the left side of the 
yorktown while the caron was grazed on the same side by the patrol 
craft us officials said 
us officials said the grazings were intentional but markov 
said the captains of the soviet ships did not have such an 
intention 
markov did not name the soviet warships but a small chart 
displayed at the briefing identified them as the frigate bezzavetny 
and the patrol ship skr6 
the official news agency tass later quoted the captain of the 
bezzavetny as saying the soviet ships came within two yards of the 
american vessels when they demanded anew that they leave the 
ussrs territorial waters 
without receiving an answer the bezzavetny and the skr6 came 
close to the us warships sides with a view to ousting them 
the captain vladimir bagdashin was quoted as saying no damage 
was caused to either the soviet or the us ships 
defense department spokeswoman susan hansen said the two us 
ships have continued what she called routine operations the 
pentagon has declined to say when the ships were to leave the black 
sea 
markov said the friday incident was the third of its kind in 
recent years 
in march 1986 the same two ships the yorktown and the caron 
violated soviet territorial waters in the black sea he said and 
two american warships penetrated soviet waters in the far east last 
year 
secretary of state george p shultz is scheduled to arrive in 
moscow next sunday to talk about a ussoviet summit meeting 
tentatively scheduled in the soviet capital in the spring

the folks who live on stamper place want 
to stamp out that name and dub their quiet hillside culdesac 
mystic view court 
the name stamper doesnt reflect the feeling of the 
neighborhood said tom hoefel a leader of the campaign to change 
the street name we just felt the street needed a pretty name 
the eight homeowners plan to present the issue to the city 
council on tuesday 
the street was named after the rev larry stamper a methodist 
minister who was a councilman in the early 1980s when the area was 
developed

confused with nearby stanford road or referred to as thumper place 
hoefel said 
council members dont oppose the change 
i dont believe in naming streets after elected officials 
anyway said mayor michael hastings except maybe somebody 
whos really important like john f kennedy or gerald ford

organizers of a muchdelayed voyage to 
israel by palestinian deportees said they chartered a new vessel 
saturday and would leave monday but some european politicians 
dropped plans to go along 
really we are going on monday said hanna nasser a member 
of a committee for the voyage by 130 palestinians deported by 
israel and hundreds of journalists and observers who have gathered 
in athens 
the journey of return is designed to focus attention on 
israels use of deportations to punish palestinians in the 
territories it captured in the 1967 middle east war 
it was initially set to start tuesday was rescheduled for 
wednesday and then for saturday 
plo officials said israeli pressure led ship owners to back out 
of charter deals prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel has 
referred to the trip as an act of war 
early saturday sources among the organizers said no contract 
had been signed for a ship 
but fouad albittar the plos diplomatic representative in 
athens said a contract to charter a vessel was signed at midday 
plo officials refused to give details about the ship citing 
security concerns 
i have a ship name but im not going to give it to you 
bassam abu sharif chief spokesman for plo chairman yasser arafat 
told reporters 
the new plan was announced at a 5 pm 10 am est meeting set 
as a deadline by european parliamentary observers for a final word 
on the voyage 
even so some who had planned to make the trip said they had to 
back out because of the delays 
i simply cant clear one more week on the schedule said 
lord christopher mayhew of britain 
others expressed fears that the latest plan might fall through 
i have been told this that the boat would sail every day 
and it hasnt happened said michael ferris an irish senator

officials of the boy scouts of america have 
voted to allow women in leadership positions including 
scoutmaster ending a policy often challenged in court of providing 
only male leadership a spokesman says 
the boy scouts had successfully defended legal challenges over 
its policy for the past 12 years but decided to drop the 
restrictions because the court challenges had become too costly a 
spokesman said saturday 
david corti a spokesman in dallas cited the great cost to 
the organization both in terms of money and in the perception of 
what we are 
we have however won our court cases and probably would 
continue to do so corti said 
the boy scouts national executive board voted for the change 
thursday during a meeting in washington dc said barclay bollas 
national news editor for the boy scouts the organization is based 
in irving 
our volunteer hierarchy felt boys of this age group should 
have the opportunity to be associated with male role models 
bollas said of the former policy 
it has cost the organization millions of dollars to defend a 
position that makes common sense said ron phillippo executive 
director of the indianhead council which includes eight counties 
in eastern minnesota and four in western wisconsin 
experts are saying men must spend more time nurturing and 
providing male role models for youth and boy scouting has provided 
this in spades phillippo said 
women had been barred from becoming scoutmasters the job of 
leading a boy scout troop as well as assistant scoutmasters 
varsity or assistant coaches or leaders of webelos the program 
for the age group between cub scouts and boy scouts 
but many positions already were open to women including the job 
of leading a cub scout troop officials said of the 11 million 
volunteers within the program nationwide about 500000 are women 
bollis said 
in fact there are many instances of women serving as trainers 
of scoutmasters he said there was never a question of the 
ability of women it was just that the boy scouts felt there ought 
to be male role models for boys 
other boy scouts officials agreed 
i think it is important to provide men an opportunity for 
nurturing too many institutions do not afford men that 
opportunity we feel we have that role in society said clarence 
hammett executive director of the viking council which includes 
15 minnesota counties 
that viewpoint was supported by judith erickson a consultant 
for the viking and indianhead councils and an associate professor 
at the university of minnesotas center for youth development and 
research 
the value in scoutings former policy has been that it 
provided boys with a nurturant male role model she said with 
this change in policy men must be serious about taking on the 
nurturant role in this and other organizations or this will be one 
more instance of women alone developing that type of close 
relationship 
but a 69yearold grandmother who waged a 14year legal battle 
to become a scoutmaster said saturday that we straightened out a 
wrong 
i think that it is a great thing that happened and i think 
its about time after trying hard for 14 years to get this stupid 
situation straightened out said catherine pollard of milford 
conn who fought an unsuccessful court battle over the issue 
i do think that this is marvelous because there have been 
women all over the united states in fact all over the world that 
have been doing these things for the boy scouts because they could 
not get a male leader but we could not get recognition for the 
things weve done she said 
mrs pollard the mother of two boys and two girls and 
grandmother to seven boys and four girls said she has proven that 
a woman can be a successful scoutmaster 
mrs pollard who has been involved with the boy scouts since 
1950 ran a milford troop from october 1973 to january 1975 because 
no men volunteered to lead it her formal application to attain 
scoutmaster status was denied by the boy scouts in 1974 and 1976 
as long as your character is good and you havent done 
anything wrong for the position youd like to hold i think we 
should hold those positions pollard said 
mrs pollard said she plans to become scoutmaster for a new 
troop adding i have some irons in the fire i had them before 
the news came out

stroessner and colorado party candidates will not be less than 80 
percent of the total said sabino montanaro interior minister 
and president of the ruling colorado party during a news 
conference saturday 
stroessner a 75yearold army general has governed since 1954

catholic university and west germanys friedrich naumann foundation

percent said they will abstain from voting and 116 percent plan to 
cast a blank vote balloting is required by law among paraguayans

balloting 
police used electric antiriot prods and tear gas saturday to 
break up a rally of 5000 antigovernment demonstrators in front of 
the national pantheon which contains the remains of the countrys 
heroes 
roman catholic radio station radio caritas said the 
demonstrators included domingo laino president of the authentic 
radical liberal party not recognized by the government in a 
brief speech laino described the elections as a new farce and 
new fraud 
but the people want freedom and we will continue making 
demands in spite of the regimes savage bullies said laino who 
police had held under house arrest for two days last week 
the radio said no one was arrested although several suffered 
slight injuries 
colorado party leaders meanwhile made lastminute calls for 
voters in this landlocked californiasized nation to turn out en 
masse sunday to reelect stroessner to an eighth straight term 
its a shame stroessner cant be elected for life said 
central bank president cesar romeo acosta at a rally in raul 
arsenio oviedo 250 miles east of asuncion he represents the 
greatness the splendor the freedom and the independence of 
paraguay 
sen luis maria vega of the liberal party and rep carlos 
ferreira ybarra of the radical liberal party are running against 
stroessner but men admitted they have no chance of winning 
the party winning the majority of votes takes twothirds of the 
congressional seats the remaining third is divided proportionally 
between the two other parties 
stroessner seized power in a may 1954 coup that ended nearly two 
decades of political chaos in paraguay the us state department 
in its 1987 human rights report released wednesday said 
paraguay has not had a democratic government since its 
independence in 1811

few politicians in massachusetts have more 
interest in the success of gov michael s dukakis presidential 
campaign than the woman who would fill his statehouse office if he 
captures the white house 
but lt gov evelyn murphy the first woman ever to hold a 
constitutional office in massachusetts is neither overwhelmed by 
the prospect of occupying the governors seat nor pressing for that 
power 
murphy 47 spent eight years day and night seven days a 
week 16 hours a day to get where she is today she said in an 
interview last week by anybodys measure it was a long time to 
get elected 
but for murphy an economist with a phd from duke university 
it was an investment made not so much as a stepping stone to the 
governors office one floor above her own 
i looked at it as a place in which i could show people what i 
could do she said 
murphy finds herself at a moment that may be unique in the 
history of the illdefined no 2 seat of authority in 
massachusetts state government 
when she campaigned for the job in 1986 she had to pitch a need 
for the post as much as her ability to fill it john kerry who had 
defeated her in her first bid for the job in 1982 abandoned the 
office after being elected to the us senate in 1984 for the next 
two years the office was vacant without much concern to anyone 
then shortly after she won the lieutenant governorship in 1986 
on a platform of turning the office into a longrange planning arm 
of state government dukakis launched his white house bid three 
months into her term murphy found her job had taken on new 
importance 
when we started out i wasnt quite clear what an acting 
governor does when the governor sets out to be president murphy 
said her role has slowly expanded as dukakis spends more time on 
the campaign trail 
but during her first year murphy had her own agenda to keep 
she had her blueprint 2000 project a twoyear series of regional 
hearings statistical analysis and predictions aimed at assessing 
the commonwealths needs into the 21st century and developing 
some very basic simple fundamental directions for the decade 
ahead 
then there was there requests from groups across the state 
wanting to get a look at the first female lieutenant governor 
there were 1000 requests in the first six months alone she 
said and you feel an obligation to go out and speak because 
people want to see what this thing is all about 
murphys role as dukakis surrogate has been eased by the 
philosophic agreement they achieved working together off and on 
over a dozen years first as his environmental affairs secretary 
and later as his economic affairs secretary 
murphy compared her development as lieutenant governor to 
dukakis as a presidential candidate 
michael and i both have the same kind of attitude towards how 
you step into uncharted waters step by step learn from each move 
what else can be taken over

democratic presidential candidates 
michael dukakis and richard gephardt swapped charges and drew fire 
from the rest of the pack saturday in a highvoltage debate 
reflecting the importance of tuesdays leadoff new hampshire 
primary 
gephardt the narrow winner in monday nights iowa caucuses 
apologized to sen albert gore jr for profane remarks made by his 
campaign manager 
but when gephardt complained that commercials being run by paul 
simons campaign were over the line he was brought up short by 
gore 
what paul simon has done is simply to spell out the record 
and you ought to respond to the substance rather than taking it 
personally said the tennessee senator 
dukakis the runaway frontrunner in the polls for next weeks 
primary came out swinging with an attack on gephardts acceptance 
of contributions from political action committees and his call for 
an oil import fee but then he was forced to field criticism from 
gary hart and bruce babbitt both men struggling for survival in 
the presidential race 
dukakis and gephardt were the frequent targets of barbs because 
of their position in the race the massachusetts governor as 
frontrunner in the new hampshire polls and the missouri 
congressman as victor in iowa 
gore continued his assault on gephardt after the event ended he 
told reporters his rival has changed an incredible list of 
positionsof course its fair for paul simon to say your 
positions are 180 degrees different he said 
jesse jackson and gephardt engaged in an intense conversation 
afterwards with jackson waving his finger at his campaign 
competitor neither man would say what they were talking about 
jackson sought to play peacemaker during the debate as he urged 
his rivals to address the issues rather than engaging in a game of 
how bruised i am 
it was babbitt the former arizona governor who spoke most 
frankly about the importance of new hampshire where he said voters 
have the power of life and death over my candidacy 
in a bid to attract voters from the audience watching the debate 
on cable news network the gore campaign aired a 30second 
commercial within a half hour of the conclusion of the event 
the candidates exchanged barbs from the very beginning in a 
reflection of the struggle for survival that the new hampshire 
primary has become they spent only a few moments at middebate 
criticizing the reagan administration 
hart and babbitt continually chided the topthree in iowa for 
failing to provide specific proposals hart complaining that 
dukakis didnt have an energy policy or a budget plan either 
wheres the beef he asked in a reprise of the line that 
walter f mondale used effectively against him in the 1984 race 
you dont know anything about putting together a budget 
replied dukakis who has served as governor of massachusetts for 10 
years and has said that now is not the time to deliver a detailed 
federal spending plan 
and what is your energy policy hart said i havent heard 
a dukakis policy yet 
thats because you havent been campaigning shot back 
dukakis gary wait a second if youd been around in the long 
hot summer and fall months youd have heard about my energy 
policy he said in a reference to harts withdrawal from the race 
after questions were raised about his relationship with miami model 
donna rice 
babbitt supporter of a national sales tax to reduce the 
deficit taunted dukakis saying wheres your budget plan 
simon locked in a battle for second place with gephardt 
according to the polls was the first candidate to speak during the 
debate sponsored by the league of women voters 
he began with an attack on the missouri congressman complaining 
that gephardts support of president reagans ax bills had led to 
the huge budget and trade deficits 
at one point gephardt defended his own shift in positions on 
several issues noting that simon had endorsed republican tom dewey 
for president in 1948 and now you base your campaign on harry 
truman 
the 60minute debate was interrupted at the outset by a heckler 
who stood at his seat and began shouting when is the democratic 
party going to do something about aids he was quickly hustled 
from the hall by security officials 
where were we said dukakis as the commotion died down 
where they were was a dukakis attack against gephardts practice 
for taking pac funds you cant beat up on the establishment and 
take their money said dukakis 
where are the pacs for the homeless where are the pacs for 
the working people who dont have health insurance he said 
babbitt who finished fifth in iowa and places the same in new 
hampshire polls took a shot of his own at gephardt for being a 
congressional insider but campaigning as an antiestablishment 
figure thats not a flipflop thats a triple back somersault 
with a half twist he said 
the democrats have been trading attacks and counterattacks in 
speeches and television ads this week as the battle moved into the 
final 72 hours 
the sharpest exchanges came between gephardt and simon 
concerning a new television ad attacking gephardt for his votes on 
nuclear power the b1 bomber taxes and other matters simon said 
the ad reveals inconsistencies in gephardts record but the 
commercial infuriated gephardt who demanded it be taken off the 
air 
gephardts apology came when gore asked him about comments made 
earlier in the week by campaign manager william carrick disparaging 
gephardt and his staff gephardt first said that carrick was sorry 
but gore persisted and asked if he was too 
of course al of course youre my friend 
the league debate is the latest in the long series of 
confrontations between the 1988 presidential hopefuls by one 
campaigns count it is the 19th such debate in 1987 and 1988

when george bush canceled an appearance at 
the last minute former gov hugh gregg raised a copy of bushs 
speech before the jilted audience and asked halfheartedly for a 
show of hands from those who wanted him to read it 
so few responded that he pocketed the papers and sat down 
its like promising your wife arpege and giving her vigoral 
a vitamin tonic gregg said 
but when the arpege is spread too thin or being applied in 
other parts of the country candidates often apply a substitute in 
the form of movie stars members of congress sports figures and 
local heroes to draw crowds and drum up support 
george bush has gov john sununu and rep judd gregg son of the 
former governor 
jack kemp has been getting a boost in person and in television 
ads from sen gordon humphrey and rep robert smith 
bob dole often has sen warren rudman of grammrudman and 
irancontra committee fame at his side accounting for the fourth 
and final member of an allgop congressional delegation that has 
been working overtime in advance of tuesdays 
earliestinthenation new hampshire primary 
rudman is so highly thought of that when bush mentioned him 
during a nationally televised debate dole quickly reminded the 
audienc that dole not bush is rudmans candidate 
kemp has brought football stars and television celebrity chad 
everett into the state 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis though a neighbor has 
called on boston sports stars to represent him while he campaigns 
in other places 
early in the campaigns surrogates are used to make phone calls 
and enlist party activists who fan out to help round up the rest of 
the troops 
i cant say how many people will vote for george bush because 
john sununu is supporting him but a lot of people who are working 
to see that george bush wins the primary are working because john 
sununu asked them to bushs new hampshire political director 
will abbott said 
when i do anything i stick my fingers in the pie said 
sununu who has made phone calls walked in parades and even 
traveled to iowa on bushs behalf 
kemps people say humphrey and smith are more valuable 
they are true grassroots conservatives and its the 
conservatives who turn out for republican primaries kemps state 
director paul young said 
paul jacobson doles new england press secretary is one of 
several members of rudmans staff on leave to help doles 
presidential effort 
they and rudman have a knowledge of new hampshire and access 
to rudmans campaign files 
you cant transfer popularity but you can eliminate 
legwork said jacobson adding that rudman can be used as a 
surrogate on almost the same level of credibility as dole 
rudman humphrey and sununu have been at odds holding news 
conferences to complain about the others candidates 
sununu complained that kemps tactics and ads have been 
stretching the fabric of the republican party rudman said kemp 
has been engaging the politics of fear and distortion that 
could cause major rifts in the party 
humphrey complained that bush and dole are distorting their 
guncontrol records 
but they all say they will bury the hatchet when the primary is 
past 
this is an intramural contest you expect some bumping and 
jostling and thats good thats healthy humphrey said 
sununu said those guys are my good friends he said he and 
the senators and congressmen will keep tweaking each others 
tails during the final days of the campaign but afterward 
well have a big party

the european economic community on 
saturday reached an agreement to end its cash crisis by limiting 
farm subsidies putting the trading bloc on course toward a bigger 
role in the international economy 
the deal also has allowed the group to step back from political 
stalemate at a time when improved relations between the superpowers 
have stirred new efforts by western europe to reassert itself on 
the world stage 
even so few of the european leaders who worked out the 
fourpoint agreement were willing to predict how long the new 
momentum would last 
dont get too cheerful said british prime minister margaret 
thatcher who has been at the center of a series of fierce 
negotiating battles to limit eec spending since she took office in 
1979 
she and leaders of the 11 other eec or common market countries 
said the brussels accord while important for its new approach to 
controlling farm spending did not necessarily mean the common 
market had seen its final budget crisis 
over the past decade bickering over money has been the main 
cause of stagnation in the eec it has retarded the organizations 
development and hampered its efforts to keep up with a 
fastchanging world economy 
the financial pressure will ease now assuming the brussels 
agreement is as expected ratified by the 12 national parliaments 
and implemented as drafted 
it was the first time in the eecs 31year history that leaders 
fixed a limit to farm spending which eats up twothirds of the 
eecs annual budget the agreement set a 344 billion limit on 
farm spending in 1988 slightly higher than last year 
the deal contains four main points 
subsidies to grain producers will for the first time be 
legally limited if effective the system of production ceilings 
and punitive price cuts for farmers will ease one of the eecs 
biggest farm problems 
the total budget of the eec will grow substantially by 
revamping the way member countries chip in from national 
treasuries the new system will gradually make the governments 
contributions correspond more closely to their national wealth 
aid to the groups poorest members will be increase by 80 
percent over five years this serves two main purposes to put all 
the members on a more even economic footing and to help the poorer 
ones cope with stiffer foreign competition once the common market 
has completed its drive to remove all internal barriers to trade by 
1992 
annual increases in overall farm spending will for the first 
time be strictly limited under a new formula each 10 percent 
increase in the eecs total economic output would allow a 74 
percent rise in the budget 
mrs thatcher said she would approve only if eec foreign 
ministers approve additional controls on farm subsidies that 
should happen soon 
the summit accord was reached in the early hours saturday after 
two full days of debate two previous eec summits last june and 
december had failed to bridge gaps between an austerityminded 
faction led by britain and a west germanled group that wanted 
looser spending controls 
the previous failures had left the common market without a 
formal budget for this year it was due to run out of money by late 
summer 
henning christophersen the eec budget commissioner said 
saturday that the eec could get its 1988 budget approved by the 
european parliament by may leaders of the 518member legislature 
which shares the budget writing authority with the member 
governments have given the reforms a grudging approval 
while the immediate crisis now appears to have passed future 
harmony is not assured 
a fundamental split remains in the member countries views about 
how far the common market should go in transforming itself from a 
trading bloc dealing mainly with economic issues to a true 
political union 
britain stresses the need to remove trade barriers between eec 
countries to give european business a wider home market from 
which to compete on a global scale with the united states and 
japan the brussels accord is likely to make this goal more 
attainable 
france and other members want to keep alive the dreams of the 
eecs founding fathers to create a single political entity a kind 
of united states of europe in which the 12 member countries would 
share common foreign defense and economic policies 
reflecting this hope jacques delors the eecs chief executive 
and a former french finance minister told reporters that the 
significance of the brussels accord went beyond the issues of 
budgets and agriculture 
we now have the political tool for the relaunching of the 
european union he said 
still the eecs track record would suggest that new progress 
toward political integration will come only gradually and only 
after new unforeseen financial crises emerge and threaten serious 
setbacks

about 2000 supporters of impeached gov 
evan mecham turned out to sing songs sign petitions and bash a car 
symbolizing his foes with sledgehammers saturday at a fundraising 
picnic 
mecham and his wife florence wearing boots blue jeans and 
checked cowboy shirts with silver and turquoise bolo ties barely 
finished their meal before fans began lining up for hugs 
autographs and words of encouragement 
there were mecham for president tshirts and cassette tapes 
of his january 1987 inaugural address there were leaflets and 
former mecham administration aides and an auction in which a bidder 
paid 15600 for the 20000 car that mechams auto dealership had 
let mecham drive as governor 
mecham brought the crowd gathered at a park here to its feet 
with a prediction that he would prevail despite what he said was 
the unwillingness of his opponents to abide by the 1986 election 
results that saw him win a threeway race on his fifth try at 
governor 
you know in some countries theyd call it a coup he said 
but in this state its not going to work 
he added without my threatened veto youre going to get your 
taxes increased this year unless i get back there before the 
appropriations bill goes through 
booths offered voters petitions to force recall elections on 
mechams political opponents much as the republican governors 
foes have forced one on him for may 17 if he survives impeachment 
and a criminal trial 
supporters flocked to a battered chevy chevelle with the words 
media bias special interest groups hidden government 
and selective prosecution painted on it 
for 1 they bought three whacks at their favorite target with a 
sledgehammer a stream of children and adults some in coats and 
ties kept up a steady rain of blows until the sledgehammer broke 
additional hammers were found and the battering continued 
tucson chef greg seader put huge dents in a panel labeled 
media bias as his wife cheryl took her turn he said too 
bad it wasnt a couple of reporters 
don ruzicka chairman of a mecham support group known as 
concerned arizona voters had already taken his whacks but said 
oh i see what i want to hit and promptly ponied up another 
dollar 
i had a hard time choosing he said im going to have to 
spend more money to hit all of them 
organizers say they sold 3000 tickets at 25 each actual 
turnout was estimated at 2000

gov evan mechams impeachment trial is 
embroiled in controversy even before it begins with disputes over 
closed state senate meetings and whether the trial should be 
delayed 
the senate is scheduled to begin hearing testimony feb 22 but 
mechams lawyer says he wants the trial put off until after the 
governor stands trial on separate criminal charges 
senate leaders are being criticized by the news media for having 
decided to hold closed meetings periodically during the impeachment 
trial the first closed meeting was held thursday minutes after 
the senators were sworn in as trial judges 
part of the confusion according to state sen greg lunn is 
that arizona senators arent used to acting as judges and jurors 
instead of lawmakers 
we dont do this very often said lunn who was one of the 
republican governors earliest critics in the party certainly 
impeaching a governor is an unprecedented situation in this state 
everyone feels the burden 
mecham was impeached feb 5 by the house on 23 separate articles 
alleging that he concealed a 350000 campaign loan misused 
80000 from the governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto 
dealership and tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death 
threat by a state official 
twothirds of the 30 senate votes are required to convict him a 
conviction would automatically remove him from office and the 
senate could bar him from holding any political office in the 
future 
mecham also faces a march 9 criminal trial on six felony charges 
involving the 350000 loan and he faces a may 17 recall election 
in which he plans to run probably against a number of opponents 
mechams lawyer murray miller said he will file a motion this 
week asking that the senate trial be delayed until after the 
criminal case on grounds the impeachment trial could endanger 
mechams constitutional right to a fair trial in criminal court 
you know in some countries theyd call it a coup mecham 
told cheering supporters saturday in glendale but in this state 
its not going to work 
about 2000 mecham supporters attended the fundraising picnic 
many paying 1 to take whacks with a sledgehammer at a battered car 
labeled with the words media bias special interest groups 
hidden government and selective prosecution 
if the senate rejects the motion to delay the impeachment trial 
miller said he may take the matter to court adding that he 
believes courts have jurisdiction in such cases 
but senate president carl kunasek a republican disagreed 
i would be interested in finding the judge that would do 
that kunasek said its called the separation of powers i do 
believe 
miller said he will probably also bring a motion challenging the 
sufficiency of the impeachment articles an effort to get a 
senate vote on whether the allegations in the articles of 
impeachment warrant a trial 
miller also doesnt like the senates decision to hold closed 
meetings 
majority leader bob usdane a republican said the meetings are 
intended to permit lawmakers to consult with their lawyers discuss 
which witnesses should be called and go over questions 
usdane said the senators also could conduct final deliberations 
behind closed doors before voting on whether to convict mecham 
in thursdays meeting senators hashed out final details on 
procedural rules for the trial the rules then were adopted on the 
floor with no debate 
kunasek promised that the trial itself will be held in the open 
and senate minority leader alan stephens a democrat contended the 
issue was being blown out of proportion by the media since the 
final vote will be public 
each and every member will be on the verge of tears or 
whatever because were going to have the same traumatic 
decision that was made in the house stephens said 
lunn said he thinks closed meetings fuel unnecessary controversy 
the only issue should be whether evan mecham should be 
impeached in light of the facts and the law lunn said by having 
closed meetings the senate will play into millers hands by giving 
him something to criticize he said 
rep mark killian a republican who cried during the house 
impeachment vote when he bitterly criticized the governor but voted 
against impeaching him said he thought the senate should have 
closed meetings only when consulting with attorneys 
otherwise killian said if hes convicted everyone will say 
well they were scheming to convict the governor or if hes 
acquitted theyll say they were scheming to acquit him 
the trial is becoming expensive house special counsel william 
french already has been paid 200000 to 250000 for conducting 
the investigation that led to the impeachment 
additional fees for french and the other house counsel paul 
eckstein and for their assistants could go over 100000 house 
leaders say the senate has hired a lawyer john lundin at 175 an 
hour 
mecham is the 16th governor impeached in us history if he is 
convicted he will be the seventh to be removed from office by an 
impeachment conviction 
he would be succeeded by secretary of state rose mofford a 
democrat who is acting governor pending the impeachment trials

and two other rebels in cano dos bocs about 150 miles southeast of 
managua the communique said both battles took place friday but did 
not list government casualties 
commander bayardo arce castano deputy coordinator of the ruling 
sandinista national liberation fronts political commission said 
evaders of the governments compulsory military service will be 
sent to jail to make the boots and the uniforms of the sandinista

additional military aid for the contra rebels on feb 3 arce 
castano charged opposition parties were seeking to give the 
reagan administration time to obtain illegal resources and other 
means to continue its criminal war against our people 
the government estimates about 43000 people have been killed in 
the war 
presidents of five central american nations signed a central 
american peace plan in guatemala last aug 7 the plan calls for

black students occupying a building at the 
university of massachusetts to protest alleged racial harassment 
stockpiled food and sleeping bags saturday and said they would stay 
until their demands are met 
protesters refused to meet with chancellor joseph d duffey when 
he went to new africa house on friday afternoon on saturday 
morning duffey again went to the house but was stopped on the 
landing by two students who said no meeting would be held until he 
met all their demands 
duffey said the school would take no reprisals against the 
protesters theyre not disrupting anything yet he said 
but he declined to outline what action might be taken if the 
building is still occupied when school reopens tuesday after the 
washingtons birthday holiday 
we consider the third world control of the new africa house to 
be a permanent one said rudy krigger a protester he said 
saturday afternoon there were about 125 minority protesters still 
in the building 
the students took over the building friday after talks with 
duffey on a list of demands which include prosecution of five 
white students accused of attacking two blacks after a dormitory 
party last weekend 
gov michael s dukakis taking time from his democratic 
presidential campaign swing through new hampshire called the 
racial incident intolerable behavior and said he discussed the 
situation with duffey and franklyn jenifer chancellor of the 
statewide higher education system 
they know i want this kind of racial problem dealt with 
firmly and promptly not only at amherst but throughout the 
system dukakis said theyve assured me thats exactly what is 
happening 
the students also asked duffey to suspend a campus police 
officer who they say arranged a police lineup of black men after 
white and minority students complained of harassment and called 
for new africa house be returned to use as a cultural center for 
the black community 
but arthur hilson head of the campus police denied saturday 
that any such lineup occurred adding that it was a rumor that was 
blown out of proportion 
the new africa house building now contains the afroamerican 
studies department in addition to other academic offices and 
classrooms about 7 percent of the schools 18000 undergraduates 
are black 
this place being turned into an academic building is robbing 
them of their cultural base on campus said dwayne warren a 
senior acting as liaison between protesters and administrators 
my first responsibility is education and this building is 
committed to education in a range of ways said duffey im not 
about to put black afroamerican professors out of this building 
the protesters who have so far declined to talk publicly are 
not affiliated with any group and numbered 150 at the height of the 
takeover friday night 
the protesters were allowed free access to and from the building 
and no banners or other indications of the takeover were visible to 
spectators 
within hours of receiving the demands friday duffey issued a 
statement condemning racism and asked campus police to no longer 
use lineups 
two of the five white students accused in the beating were 
ordered to move out of campus residence halls friday after a 
disciplinary hearing a feb 24 court hearing is scheduled to 
determine whether there is sufficient evidence to charge the five 
students with criminal violations 
the head of campus police met saturday with students and black 
community leaders to line up creature comforts in case of 
arrests 
i want to be prepared to do something in a sensitive caring 
and humane way said hilson a black baptist minister who came to 
the police department from the career planning office amid 
criticism of police handling of a 1986 racial clash 
i think there is a way to do it other than the ways ive seen 
in the past said hilson were talking about students making a 
statement not criminals these are students who have a belief in 
what theyre doing 
food money and sleeping bags had been donated to the students 
mark codlingdave a sophomore and spokesman for the protesters 
said earlier the group had received an inadequate response to 
its demands 
the protesters cited racial tensions that have surfaced at the 
school since 10 students were injured in a racial clash on oct 27 
1986 following the boston red sox loss to the new york mets in the 
final game of the world series 
blacks at the university which has a total of 25000 students 
said an undercurrent of racism has not abated since that clash

pat robertson predicted a strong finish 
as his new hampshire campaign entered its final weekend while a 
television interview aired in which he said libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi should have been captured or killed 
robertson in a wideranging interview with david frost said he 
would not have hesitated to kill gadhafi that repeated acts of 
adultery would disqualify a potential president and that 
homosexuals should receive no special legal protection 
meanwhile in an interview with the associated press the former 
television evangelist said a strong showing in tuesdays primary 
will boost his republican presidential campaign as he heads toward 
friendly territory in the south 
robertson said gadhafi whose adopted infant daughter was killed 
during an attack on his headquarters by us navy jets in 1986 
should have been taken out of the picture completely 
my sentiment was that we should have taken him prisoner gone 
after him somehow taken his power base away from him whatever 
that took robertson said i wouldnt have hesitated to kill 
him hes a madman and he was a terrorist 
regarding adultery he said how could we be secure if we 
thought that the president of the united states was bedding down 
with a girlfriend of a mafia boss as john kennedy did or gary 
hart who knows who his girlfriends would normally be 
in todays world i think repeated dalliances and lies to 
cover them up i think are a disqualification for a presidential 
candidate robertson said 
robertson said homosexuals should be treated like other 
citizens but i cannot see that we would write this sexual 
practice into our law and give it a protected status 
robertson who finished second in the iowa caucuses trailing 
senate minority leader bob dole but ahead of vice president george 
bush told the ap he expects to finish no lower than third in new 
hampshire 
whether i come in third second or first i will be 
beautifully positioned to go out of here into the south 
robertson said i have a very strong organization in the south 
my polling shows that 38 percent of the new hampshire 
republican and independent voters are still undecided with only a 
few days left to go he said 
he said the secondplace finish in iowa has helped his fund 
raising but he would not reveal how much money has come in 
he said former secretary of state alexander haigs withdrawal 
from the gop race friday and his endorsement of dole is not going 
to make a great deal of difference in the outcome in new hampshire 
im going to pick up some of the haig support and some may go 
to bob dole but i dont think theres going to be much of a ripple 
for any of us he said

abu nidals radical palestinian guerrilla 
group on saturday denounced as blackmail and a disgrace an 
italian court verdict that convicted him of masterminding a 1985 
bombing attack at rome airport 
the verdict is an attempt to overshadow the glorious uprising 
of our people in the west bank and the gaza strip against israeli 
occupation it is a disgrace to italian justice said a statement 
issued by abu nidals fatahrevolutionary council faction 
the statement was issued in beirut a day after a rome court 
handed down the conviction verdict and sentenced abu nidal in 
absentia to life in prison 
sixteen people were killed and more than 80 injured in the 
grenade and rifle fire attack at rome airport on dec 27 1985 an 
almost simultaneous bombing attack at vienna airport killed four 
people and wounded 47 
the statement signed by atef abu bakr the groups chief 
spokesman accused the italian judiciary of bias 
italian justice closes its eyes to the crimes israel is 
committing against our people in the occupied territories these 
crimes place israel on the top of the terrorists list it said 
why has italian justice failed to make any move when israeli 
secret agents assassinated several palestinian leaders on italian 
soil isnt that evidence that italian justice covers up for 
israeli crimes isnt that blackmail the statement said without 
elaborating 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna is a former 
official of yasser arafats fatah group he split with arafat in 
early 1970s and heads the fatah revolutionary council his group is 
not part of arafats palestine liberation organization

the diskshaped milky way galaxy is not flat but 
resembles instead a warped phonograph record and is adorned with a 
delicate scalloped edge new observations show 
the scalloping is something we dont understand leo blitz 
an astronomer at the university of maryland said saturday 
speaking at the annual meeting of the american association for 
the advancement of science blitz said our picture of the galaxy 
has changed significantly in the last five to 10 years 
the milky way once considered merely a typical example of a 
spiral galaxy is now thought to be a much more exciting and 
interesting aggregation among the recent findings reported 
saturday were 
ninety percent of the galaxy is invisible and nobody knows 
what this huge dark halo is made of 
the galaxy is powered by two compact objects at its center 
that might be the remnants of starburst formation or that could be 
associated with a black hole 
the galaxys dark halo could be full of remnants of the big 
bang called weakly interactive massive particles or wimps 
the galaxy consists of a slim starstudded disk about 100000 
lightyears across blitz said a light year is about 6 trillion 
miles 
surrounding that visible disk is a cloud of hydrogen gas 
extending another 25000 lightyears 
it is at the edge of that gaseous disk that radio astronomers 
have found warping and scalloping blitz said 
beyond that lies 90 percent of the mass of the galaxy it is 
invisible and astronomers dont know what it is said martin rees 
of cambridge university 
it could be made of a trillion very small faint stars each 
onetenth the size of the sun another possibility is that it is 
composed of black holes the remnants of massive stars 
or it could be made of wimps an explanation that rees said is 
more radical than the others 
what we want to do is narrow down the possibilities rees 
said what we see is a trace of sediment in a universe where 
galaxies in a cosmic sea are dominated by this missing matter 
the galaxys oddities are not limited to its outer edges 
however the inner 10 percent of our galaxy seems to be unique 
said leonid ozernoy of the harvardsmithsonian center for 
astrophysics in cambridge mass the star density is huge there 
it is also a powerful source of radiation emitting infrared 
xrays and gamma rays ozernoy said 
a black hole could lie at the center of the galaxy driving its 
rotation such a black hole could be the remnant of starburst 
formation ozernoy said 
observations yet to be made could resolve some of the puzzles 
that remain rees said 
it might be possible he said to use gravitational lenses 
areas in space in which gravity bends light in the same way that a 
magnifying glass does to see small faint stars in the dark halo 
if they exist 
experiments are being planned in the united states and europe to 
try to identify the wimps if they exist rees said 
the problem of missing mass is one that extends across the 
entire universe not only in the milky way rees said and the 
discovery of new particles in this invisible matter would have a 
payoff so colossal that the modest investment in such experiments 
seems more than justified rees said in his prepared remarks

natos american commander was quoted 
as saying saturday that new us chemical weapons should be 
deployed in europe but acknowledged that objections by european 
allies could prevent the move 
in an interview with the munichbased newspaper sueddeutsche 
zeitung gen john galvin chief nato commander in europe was 
quoted as saying the new binary chemical weapons should be 
stationed where the troops are 
the view is at odds with an agreement between the united states 
and west germany not to replace aging chemical weapons stored in 
west germany with a new generation of such weapons 
the newspaper said galvin acknowledged there were objections 
to his position among nato allies 
if these objections cannot be resolved then we will have to 
find an alternative that alternative appears to be not to station 
the weapons in europe galvin was quoted as saying 
chancellor helmut kohl foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
and other west german officials have repeatedly called for the 
worldwide destruction of chemical weapons 
horst jungmann a security expert for the opposition social 
democrats on saturday criticized galvins comments and the us 
decision to build the weapons 
the us decision to begin production of binary chemical 
weapons has set back any hope of achieving an agreement to 
eliminate such weapons in the near future jungmann said in a 
radio interview in hamburg 
he said the social democrats would oppose the deployment of new 
chemical weapons in west germany 
in december the us army resumed producing chemicals for the 
weapons president richard nixon ordered us production of 
chemical weapons halted in 1969 but president reagan said the 
resumed production was needed to offset the increasing soviet 
arsenal of chemical weapons 
the binary weapons are composed of two chemicals kept separate 
until a bomb drops or an artillery shell is fired the two then 
mix forming a deadly gas

thousands of people grabbed for cheap beads 
and aluminum doubloons tossed from parade floats saturday the 
opening day of an unusual fourday mardi gras weekend and 
thousands more queued up to board a giant aircraft carrier 
the glitziest the krewe of endymion boasted party pooch spuds 
mckenzie accompanied by his corps of noncanine cuties the 
spudettes as its grand marshal spuds is the first animal to 
serve as grand marshal of endymion which always invites a 
celebrity of some sort to lead off its fancy floats 
the beer company spokesdog rode low in a tall directors chair 
snout between paws nose pointing down and sporting a hangdog look 
spuds float followed those of countrywestern charmer dolly 
parton who tossed doubloons dynasty star heather locklear 
whose black sequined gown drew shouts from the crowd and soulful 
crooner smokey robinson 
in all nine parades were scheduled saturday in new orleans and 
its suburbs starting at noon and ending well after dark there 
will be parades every day through fat tuesday itself 
a line five deep and about four blocks long snaked from the uss 
forrestal which docked at new orleans to give its crew of 5000 a 
great weekend and to give civilians a look at the largest warship 
ever to come to the city 
announcements over speakers from the ship and military police on 
shore patrol advised people in line that it would take those at the 
end three to four hours to get aboard 
for those unwilling to wait that long or uninterested in seeing 
the 1039footlong ship and its fighters attack bombers 
antisubmarine jets and electronic warfare planes there were the 
parades 
mardi gras is a state holiday and the federal governments 
celebration of washingtons and lincolns birthdays gave state 
workers monday off as well 
all new orleans parades have one thing in common the masked 
and costumed riders throw beads and plastic toys to the crowds 
which scream scramble and sometimes even scuffle for the trinkets 
why 
ive been here for 22 years and i still wonder what makes 
people go bananas over junk jewelry said dr fred koenig a 
sociology professor at tulane its not even jewelry junk 
still the parade watchers will go to extremes for the plastic 
beads whistles dolls and so on and maybe even once in a while a 
doubloon a big aluminum coin designed for each parade group 
even babies perched high atop step ladders are encouraged to beg 
for the trinkets as the crowds scream throw me something 
mister 
its having a chance to get something that is free that is 
not easy to get koenig said that has some appeal you get 
this kind of gratification prestige like knowing somebody on a 
float 
its competitiveness that is engendered there on the sides of 
the parade routes explained dr cameron camp an assistant 
professor of psychology at the university of new orleans you 
want to get it before someone else does

a white man accused of threatening blacks with a 
baseball bat and yelling racial slurs would be ordered to work for 
the naacp under a proposed sentencing agreement 
i think working 200 hours for the naacp is certainly going to 
teach him something cook county judge stuart nudelman said 
hes going to learn how to be a responsible human being 
james kalafut 22 is charged with aggravated assault and ethnic 
intimidation he is accused of joining a group of six whites and 
hispanics who brandished baseball bats and threw bottles as they 
chased two blacks from a transit stop last august 
neither black was injured police said 
nudelman said he plans to sentence kalafut feb 23 officials of 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
could reject the courtarranged agreement after interviewing 
kalafut 
kalafuts lawyer barry silver said his client will accept the 
agreement to perform community service work for the naacp if the 
agreement falls through kalafut would stand trial and would face 
up to a year in jail on each charge if convicted 
the sentencing is a very good move by the judge to help the 
young man remove a prejudice silver said it is a terrific 
idea it lets the punishment fit the crime 
perhaps with his gang he could be a terror but when he has to 
survive in the middle of the black community he might have a whole 
different presence said edward mcclellan executive secretary of 
an naacp branch on the south side 
if theres a new way to deal with old kinds of problems why 
shouldnt we interact he said 
still mcclellan said he wants to interview kalafut to gauge 
his attitude about the sentence if it is not constructive in 
nature then i give him back to the judge he said 
kalafuts teenage brother larry was sentenced last march to 
six years in prison for firebombing the home of a black family who 
moved into gage park a predominantly white neighborhood

a couple locked in a legal tugofwar 
over baby m will meet with mary beth whiteheadgould in an attempt 
to reach a settlement on visitation for the surrogate mother a 
newspaper reported saturday 
william and elizabeth stern agreed to a private meeting after 
much soulsearching said their attorney gary n skoloff the 
starledger of newark reported 
when the state supreme court ruled on the case earlier this 
month it directed a superior court judge to set visitation 
guidelines for mrs whiteheadgould and the nearly 2yearold child 
the states highest court overturned a lower court decision that 
upheld a 10000 contract under which mrs whiteheadgould was 
artificially inseminated with sterns sperm and bore the child for 
him and his wife 
in addition to stripping her of her parental rights the lower 
court last march 31 awarded custody of the baby to the sterns 
the supreme court maintained custody for the sterns but voided 
the contract and and the termination of mrs whiteheadgoulds 
parental rights and ruled she was entitled a hearing on visiting 
her child she now gets to visit the child two hours a week under 
a temporary visitation order 
as of late last week a court date for a visitation hearing 
before superior court judge birger m sween had not been set 
harold cassidy attorney for mrs whiteheadgould did not say 
what visitation she would seek during the meeting with the sterns 
or when the meeting would take place the newspaper said 
the proposed meeting marks the first time the sterns have 
pursued an outofcourt settlement in the dispute over baby m 
named melissa by the sterns 
the sterns have decided after much soulsearching and 
additional professional advice that it is in the best interest of 
melissa stern to seek a meeting with the surrogate and her 
husband dean gould skoloff said 
cassidy did not return a phone call to his home on saturday

former president jimmy carter speaking 
saturday at the dedication of a new national historic site in his 
hometown praised the integrity and compassion of his neighbors 
saying they have traits that could benefit the rest of the country 
this is not just an opportunity to tell a story about a little 
farm boy who became president carter told 450 shivering 
wellwishers gathered at the 19th century railroad station that 
served as his 1976 campaign headquarters 
it is an opportunity to tell the story to visitors from this 
nation and around the world of what america is all about 
you can talk to almost anyone who lives here and see 
characteristics of strength of honesty of integrity of 
compassion of understanding and of support carter said 
legislation signed into law dec 23 designates carters home 
the railroad depot a vacant brick building where he graduated from 
high school in 1941 and his boyhood home in nearby archery as a 
national historic site 
john tucker who will manage the site in addition to his duties 
as superintendent of the andersonville national historic site said 
the park service will open the depot for tours and preserve carter 
memorabilia displayed in a small museum there 
the park service also will offer tours of plains and eventually 
will restore the depot the high school and carters boyhood home 
the carters will donate their fourbedroom ranchstyle house built 
in 1961 to the park service but will continue to occupy it 
throughout their lifetimes 
on hand for the ceremony were sen wyche fowler and rep richard 
ray two georgia democrats who led a sixyear effort to win 
congressional approval for the site 
ray whose district includes plains said the success of a farm 
boy who went on to become a state senator a governor and the 
nations 39th president is an example of what this country is all 
about 
president carter was an excellent president and during the 
past five to seven years weve found out he was an even better 
president than we thought he was he said 
william penn mott jr director of the national park service 
said plains has the potential to become one of the top visitor 
attractions in the south 
by itself the life story of jimmy carter has earned a place 
in our hearts as well as our history he said but it struck me 
that we also have an opportunity to tell another story here the 
story of the rural south its agricultural heritage the strength 
and character of its people 
currently about 80000 visitors a year stop at plains small 
welcome center in a few years after the park service has improved 
some of the attractions plains could attract up to 300000 
visitors a year tucker said

a note purportedly from the kidnappers of 
two un relief workers said saturday the hostages would be freed 
within a week if their interrogation proved their innocence 
also saturday palestinian refugees set fires and blocked roads 
to protest the kidnappings which the un relief agency blamed on 
palestinian individuals acting without a political motive 
in other developments a beirut newspaper printed a valentine 
from the heartsick family of an american hostage and received 
hundreds of other cards supporting other foreigners held hostage in 
lebanon also a christian militia freed eight men and a 
15yearold boy taken seven weeks ago from a danish ship it claimed 
carried arms for a druse militia 
the handwritten note in arabic left at a western news agency 
office in beirut was the first claim of responsibility since jan 
stening 44 and william jorgensen 58 were abducted by gunmen on 
the outskirts of lebanons southern port city of sidon feb 5 
the abduction was not a stupid or silly action the note 
said it was carried out for security purposes they will be 
interrogated in light of the information in our possession 
if their innocence is established they will be set free within

president reagan and mexican president 
miguel de la madrid met in this sundrenched resort saturday 
stressing positive relations but acknowledging sharp differences 
over central america policy and illegal drug trafficking 
de la madrid at a luncheon with reagan complained that 
mexicos efforts to curb drug production and trafficking are 
still not appreciated to their full extent and are the target of 
disinformation 
he said it was unlikely that any country devoted as much 
resources to the fight as mexico 
in a pointed reference to the united states de la madrid said 
the battle against drugs cannot be won unless drug consumption is 
attacked with the same vigor as the fight against production and 
trafficking 
although about 25 percent of the mexican army is engaged in the 
antidrug campaign the united states says the effort is not enough 
is hampered by official corruption and that the flow of drugs is 
increasing 
reagan in his luncheon remarks said the people in the 
united states are now turning away from drugs and that 
development should curb the demand that fuels the trafficking 
the two leaders held private talks in a seaside hotel in 
mazatlan which is in the state of sinaloa the main center for 
mexicos illegal drug trade following the fourhour meeting 
reagan was flying to california for a fournight stay at his santa 
barbara ranch 
the leaders conferred privately for 45 minutes with only 
notetakers present reagan told de la madrid that mexico has been 
very cooperative in fighting drugs but urged him to work harder 
this is the year we have to show results reagan told the 
mexican leader according to a white house statement 
reagan pronounced himself extremely pleased with our 
discussions and the remarkable record of achievements of their 
talks 
as they posed for pictures reagan was asked if he agreed with 
de la madrid that drug use was the root of the whole problem it 
always has been reagan replied 
elliott abrams assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs told reporters on air force one there was a serious 
possibility the united states would find that mexico should 
remain eligible for aid from international financial institutions 
even though its drug program falls somewhat short 
a firm opponent reagans campaign to fund the contra rebels in 
nicaragua de la madrid called for negotiated settlements in 
central america that take into account the legitimate and 
essential interests of the parties in conflict with a sense of 
fairness and evenhandedness 
he said peace would be possible only if all the governments of 
central america comply with the commitments that they have made 
at the highest level 
for his part reagan said our commitment to democracy in our 
hemisphere must be unshakeable 
he said totalitarian systems in the soviet union cuba and 
nicaragua have demonstrated for all to see that tyranny doesnt 
work mexico and the united states have a common interest in 
stable free and democratic governments in this hemisphere 
he expressed hopes for a common usmexican stand against the 
expansion of totalitarianism 
the white house statement said reagan in his private talks 
underscored his support for the contras and repeated his 
commitment to the peace process it quoted de la madrid as saying 
mexico is supportive of the fournation peace accord signed in 
guatemala 
later at a briefing for reporters secretary of state george 
shultz said that while differences over central america were 
discussed there were no heated words asked whether the two 
sides had come closer on the subject he said that was not a 
particular focus of the talks 
asked if mexico should do more to combat drugs shultz said 
yes and so does the united states so do we all its a 
tremendous problem 
in his luncheon remarks de la madrid said mexicos huge foreign 
debt 105 billion continues to be one of the major obstacles 
to development in my country 
he said there is an urgent need to find new formulas to 
adjust debt servicing to the capacity of debtor countries to pay 
and to permit them to boost growth and recover their living 
standards which have been so greately affected by this long 
crisis 
reagan said there is reason for optimism on the debt 
problem he said mexicos plan to exchange some of its debt for 
special bonds which are backed by us zero coupon bonds was an 
innovative idea 
reagan got a redcarpet welcome and a 21gun salute as he 
stepped off air force one 
in his welcoming remarks de la madrid said today we affirm 
that our relations are conducted on a very positive level 
he said their summit the sixth and final meeting of the two 
outgoing presidents would strengthen the basis for good and 
productive relations and be a forum for discussing problems as 
frankly as we always have 
reagan cited usmexican steps on trade economic problems and 
law enforcement and said we can be proud of what has been 
accomplished in so short a period 
he said their meeting paved the way for a new generation of 
political leaders in both our countries who will soon follow us and 
build on the foundation weve laid 
that foundation is cemented by our shared values and common 
goals a better quality of life for our peoples opportunties for 
our children and the dignity of living peacefully in free and 
democratic societies reagan said 
he said much remains to be done but we can be proud of the 
legacy we leave 
while the two leaders met senior officials from both countries 
held talks of their own focusing on foreign policy trade drugs 
and law enforcement 
reagan was accompanied by shultz treasury secretary james a 
baker iii attorney general edwin meese iii and trade 
representative clayton yeutter 
one agreement was signed allowing more mexican textile and 
apparel exports into the united states 
the agreement already in the process of being implemented 
gives mexico the sixth largest supplier of textiles to the united 
states an automatic 6 percent increase in exports to that rich 
market in the next four years 
although minor in scope the pact symbolizes the cooperation 
between the two countries as mexico seeks to increase its exports 
and at the same time open its own market to more us products by 
reducing tariffs 
another accord dealing with telecommunications had been 
expected to be signed but was pulled back because of a 
lastminute minor screw up said abrams he said he expected it 
would be signed in a few days 
reagan also devoted his weekly radio address to the summit 
while avoiding direct criticism of mexicos support of the 
leftist government of nicaragua reagan said the establishment of 
soviet and cubanbacked totalitarian regimes is a threat to 
stability and freedom 
nowhere is that threat more acute than in central america 
reagan said i would hope that the united states and mexico will 
find common interest in opposing any such totalitarian threat 
the summit falls just two weeks before reagan must ertify 
whether drug trafficking nations such as mexico have made adequate 
progress attacking the problem 
for nations that fail to win certification the united states is 
required by law to vote against proposed loans in the world bank 
international monetary fund and other international financial 
institutions

upcoming ussoviet negotiations on nuclear 
testing are expected to finalize a plan on joint test blasts to be 
held in both countries by june a soviet envoy said saturday 
in a related development the new york times reported that 
moscow wants limits on sealaunched nonnuclear cruise missiles a 
move that appeared to toughen the soviet position at the arms talks 
igor palenykh moscows chief delegate said the test blasts 
will help the two sides reach agreement preferably in the first 
half of 1988 on anticheating measures intended to lead to the 
ratification of two 1970s superpower treaties limiting the power of 
test blasts 
palenykh said that after ratification on the 1970s test ban 
treaties both sides should proceed to limit and ultimately ban 
nuclear tests 
he spoke to reporters at geneva airport after arriving for a 
second round of nuclear talks to begin monday 
in the first round of talks in november us and soviet 
negotiations reached basic agreement to demonstrate technology for 
detecting blast yields during experiments at the main us and 
soviet test ranges 
the second round is expected to set the dates and settle all 
questions of the preparation and conduct of the joint tests 
palenykh said 
in january teams of us and soviet scientists made fiveday 
inspection tours of the soviet test range at semipalatinsk and the 
us site in the nevada desert 
the times in its sunday editions said the reagan 
administration officials thought the two sides agreed during the 
december summit meeting in washington that cruise missiles carrying 
conventional warheads will not be covered by a new strategic arms 
treaty 
the soviets are asking that the number of the longrange 
sealaunched weapons armed with conventional warheads be limited to 
600 the newspaper reported 
it said the soviet proposal calls for a limit of 400 
nucleararmed sealaunched cruise missiles for a total limit of 
1000 of the guided longrange subsonic weapons 
the united states which is planning to have 2643 
conventionally armed cruise missiles for use at sea opposes the 
inclusion of such missiles in a new treaty arguing they are needed 
to improve the united states capability to fight without nuclear 
weapons the times said 
the times said some experts speculate that the soviet union 
wants a cap on the total number of sealaunched cruise missiles 
because it is difficult to distinguish between cruise missiles 
armed with nuclear and nonnuclear warheads

customs agents seized 14 tons of 
heroin hidden in bales of rubber sheets bound for new york in what 
is believed to be the worlds largest heroin bust officials said 
saturday 
the 2822 pounds of no 4 grade heroin with a street value of 2 
billion were aboard a freighter at klong toey port in bangkok 
said viroj laohaphan director general of the customs department 
no 4 grade heroin is 97 percent pure 
viroj said the drug was discovered when customs officials 
acting on a tip began opening the 665 bales earlier this week 
heroin had been found in 62 bales by the time the search was 
completed friday night he told a news conference 
the packing in rubber sheets prevented police dogs from 
smelling the heroin viroj said if this amount of heroin had 
left thailand it would have killed an uncountable number of 
people 
viroj said thai authorities have questioned an employee of the 
shipping company but made no arrests 
the ship was to leave for new york later this month authorities 
said 
customs officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
rainstorm thursday aroused suspicions about the cargo the 
officials said nothing was found until officials noticed the white 
powder seeping out of bales wet with rain and noticed that some 
soaked bales weighed more than others 
viroj said the previous largest heroin bust was of 2640 pounds 
seized in france in 1972 
ross petzing spokesman for the us embassy in bangkok said 
the biggest previous heroin seizure that us drug enforcement 
administration officials in thailand could recall was a haul also 
of 2640 pounds 
that seizure was made several years ago on a shrimp boat off the 
coast of a central american country petzing said he said he had 
no further details of that bust 
petzing said no 4 grade heroin cut diluted and sold on the 
streets of new york would fetch about 16 million a kilogram 
which equals 22 pounds he quoted dea agents as saying the drug 
probably was bought in northern thailand for about 4400 a kilo 
the officials said the heroin was believed to have come from 
southeast asias golden triangle a major drug producing 
region where the borders of thailand laos and burma converge 
he said the rubber bales were to have been exported by the 
rubber plus importexport company to the aic company in the new 
york city borough of queens he said us authorities had inspected 
300 bales at the companys elmhurst queens warehouse but did not 
find incriminating evidence 
viroj said he received information however that a woman 
representative of aic was arrested 
news reports said the manager of the rubber plus importexport 
had disappeared and police found its offices in bangkok deserted 
thai authorities seized 1496 pounds of heroin aboard a trawler 
off the southern province of chumphon last oct 20 in what was then 
described as thailands biggest heroin bust

a team of engineers has urged nasa to change 
the heatresistant lining on the nozzle of the space shuttles 
booster rockets because of questions about the materials 
durability a published report said sunday 
four of the six engineers who took part in the study believe 
that the lining could produce a borderline performance and 
should be altered before the next shuttle flight scheduled for 
august the washington post reported 
the two other researchers dissented stating that the problem 
was not quite so serious 
tests have resulted in fractures so numerous so large so 
closely spaced and so extensive that the integrity of the entire 
nozzle came into question said the scientists study obtained 
by the post 
the report was prepared by a team of engineers from morton 
thiokol inc the shuttle rockets manufacturer and from the 
national aeronautics and space administration it was presented to 
nasa two weeks ago 
the nozzle is a sort of exhaust pipe at the bottom of the 
shuttles two booster rockets more than 12 feet in diameter 
through which superhot gases are blasted during liftoff 
the nozzles interior is coated with an inchthick 
carbonandresin material in which nasa scientists have noted 
erosion in flights as long ago as 1983 
the report blames the erosion on excessive water and gases 
trapped in the material during its manufacture and recommends 
changes in processing techniques 
but one of the two dissenting engineers former thiokol engineer 
gc lamere wrote that the changes would unnecessarily 
increase costs and that there is insignificant data to show 
that they would be effective

a federal judge friday sentenced a 
former state auditor general to six years in prison for 
racketeering and tax fraud related to a sickening pattern of 
soliciting accepting and paying bribes 
al benedict a onetime gubernatorial hopeful also was fined 
20000 by us middle district senior judge malcolm muir who said 
the sentence was intended as a deterrent for other public officials 
the judge ordered benedict to surrender to us marshals on 
march 14 
benedict 58 pleaded guilty last month to charges of 
racketeering and tax fraud the racketeering charge encompassed 10 
state briberyrelated charges which the government said occurred 
between april 1976 and november 1984

promoting state workers and for awarding nobid contracts he also 
admitted making a 6000 payoff to a lawmaker in return for a 
bigger state appropriation for his department 
i could never express to you how i feel the pain 
suffering embarrassment humiliation benedict said in court 
all i can attempt to do is atone for my transgressions and sins 
benedict refused to answer reporters questions as he left the 
courthouse his lawyer arthur goldberg said benedict was 
surprised but not angered by the sentence 
he could have been sentenced to up to 23 years in prison and 
125000 in fines federal prosecutors asked for a light sentence 
citing benedicts cooperation in a continuing investigation of 
stategovernment corruption

oneyear sentence with early parole and a term of public service 
the memorandum portrays benedict a former television 
commentator who became de facto head of the state democratic party 
during two terms as auditor general as a broken humiliated man

jobselling scheme kerr was sentenced to two to five years in 
prison and remains free on bail he led investigators to benedict 
late in 1986 
among the spectators at the sentencing was joanne dwyer widow

a news conference last year one day before he was to be sentenced 
by muir on briberyconspiracy charges

to shorten his prison term and said her husband never got a chance 
to bargain because he was innocent and had been framed

anticipating higher numbers of refugees from 
southeast asia and soviet bloc countries two organizations urged 
the united states on friday to raise entry ceilings rather than 
shift immigration quotas among regions to compensate 
the us committee for refugees a refugee protection agency 
and the hebrew immigrant aid society migration agency of the us 
jewish community urged the reagan administration and congress to 
invoke emergency procedures of the 1980 us refugee act for 
raising the total number of admissions 
the administration has been considering a shift of 5000 from 
the southeast asian entry quota to provide for additional places 
for soviet jews and armenians from europe said uscr director roger 
p winter in a statement 
such a shift would have a disastrous impact on the safety of 
vietnamese boat people refugees fleeing to thailand winter 
said this is because temporary refugee entry into thailand depends 
on prospects for resettlement elsewhere 
the government is also proposing to reallocate 4000 entry 
places originally allocated for 1988 refugees from africa the near 
east and latin america winter said 
the increased refugee flow from the soviet union and other bloc 
countries is a direct result of the foreign policy successes of 
this administration said hebrew immigrant aid society official 
karl d zukerman in a telegram to secretary of state george shultz 
such a challenge to our human rights and refugee policies 
cannot go unanswered nor should the lives and dignity of one set 
of refugees be balanced against others zukerman said

a coalition of antismoking groups next fall will 
launch a 12year campaign to teach firstgraders nationwide about 
the dangers of cigarette smoking 
the national cancer society the american lung association and 
the american heart association want to persuade the graduating high 
school class of 2000 estimated at more than 3 million students 
not to smoke 
officials hope that at least a third of the firstgraders in 
school this fall will be introduced to specially tailored 
antismoking material throughout their grammar school years 
the momentum is with us said michele kling a spokeswoman 
for the lung association we see these children the class of 
2000 as the ambassadors of a future smokefree generation 
previewed thursday at a public hearing of the national cancer 
advisory board in miami the campaign is a response to us surgeon 
general c everett koops challenge to make the united states 
smokefree by 2000 
the class 2000 project also parallels the national cancer 
institutes goal of cutting the annual cancer death rate in half by 
2000 through increased prevention detection and screening 
the firstyear goal of the campaign is to reach students in 
27000 elementary schools 
lobbyists for the tobacco industry which antismoking forces 
criticize for running ads seductive to teenagers were unwilling 
to predict what impact the project could have on the industry 
although they didnt endorse the concept they stopped short of 
criticizing it 
we dont think kids ought to smoke either so from that 
perspective i dont have a problem with it said brennan moran 
assistant to the president of the tobacco institute my feelings 
about this change when were talking about adults when someone is 
an adult they have the right to make their own decision 
during the first year children will learn what no smoking signs 
mean and how to politely ask a smoker not to smoke said dorothy 
marcus spokeswoman for the american cancer society and coordinator 
for the project

a short ride from the white house where 
president reagan has waged a sevenyear campaign against drugs 
people are being gunned down onebyone in a high stakes drug war 
that shows no signs of abating 
the murders are coming at a record rate double that of last 
year police say its just a matter of time before a bystander 
is struck in the crossfire 
this drug problem is by no means unique to the district but 
has now reached epidemic proportions affecting the entire nation 
inspector larry soulsby former head of the district police 
homicide branch said recently 
it has now become a manmade plague acting as a cancer which 
eats away at the very fabric of our society he said 
still the death toll in washington alone is staggering in the 
first 43 days of 1988 there were 46 murders 35 of them attributed 
to the drug trade police said many were open hits in which 
victims were shot several times 
last year 57 percent of the 228 murders in the city were drug 
related compared to 33 percent in 1986 
police chief maurice turner says police will be issued 9mm 
semiautomatic weapons to match the firepower drug dealers from new 
york and miami are using to force their way into the citys drug 
market 
police claim many of these outoftown drug dealers are 
jamaicans and they have formed a jamaican task force with 
officers from federal agencies and other police departments in the 
region 
turner said the dealers are importing the highly potent cocaine 
derivative crack and using extreme violence to stake out their 
turf 
crack is now the drug of choice in the nations capital 
replacing the hallucingen pcp turner said 
vials of crack that sell for 10 to 15 in new york may sell for 
more than 30 in washington according to narcotics investigators 
turner said more than 200 dealers come to the nations capital 
each weekend from new york city some carrying 1000 vials of 
crack they sublease apartments where they make their sales 
on monday morning they go back to new york richer than when 
they came here they make big money they spend big money and they 
go back with big money turner said 
the residents here tell you about their fear and concern that 
drug dealers are terrorizing neighborhoods said turner it 
reminds me in some cases of wild west shootouts 
the city says it is fighting back by coordinating among city 
agencies neighboring jurisdictions in maryland and virginia and 
the federal government and putting more police officers on the 
street 
mayor marion barry jr refuses to put a dollar figure on the 
citys effort money is not the only answer it is only part of 
it he said we are going to use whatever resources we have 
bigger doesnt necessarily mean better 
federal spending for drug enforcement prevention and treatment 
has tripled since reagan took office rising from 11 billion in 
1981 to 34 billion in 1988 the white house is requesting that 
38 billion be allocated for fiscal 1989 said paul sirovatka 
policy analyst for the white house drug abuse policy office 
in washington 15 of the murders have been in the seventh police 
district a far corner of the citys poor anacostia section which 
police say holds the greatest share of washingtons estimated 50 to 
60 openair drug markets 
thirteen of the 15 have been blamed on drugs 
bobby larnell parker jrs death last monday is an example of 
the open hit that has become all too familiar in the city 
police said parnell had recently stolen four kilos of cocaine 
worth 280000 and cash from a drug dealer 
as he drove a new luxury automobile through a busy section of 
anacostia in the early evening he was shot him a dozen times with 
semiautomatic and automatic weapons 
that was an open hit theres no question about it thats 
very brazen very daring turner said 
even as the police chief spoke wednesday afternoon a baltimore 
man was being killed in a hail of gunfire behind an apartment 
complex in anacostia 
the shooting of charles edward russell 29 also appeared to be 
drug related police said later 
the general public is not caught up in this now but its just 
a matter of time before someone is struck in the crossfire said 
the police chief 
we have younger and younger individuals who are arming 
themselves with semiautomatic weapons the chief said 
stressing the point to reporters police last week displayed 
some of the 410 firearms they have seized in the city so far this 
year 68 percent more than they had gotten in the same period last 
year 
there were several uzis laid out before television cameras and 
one officer said the arsenal would be wellsuited for warfare in 
the middle east 
parents and church leaders meanwhile are appalled at the 
involvement of youths in bigtime crime 
nineteen of the murder victims last year under 18 years old 
compared to just six in 1986 
there were 1780 juvenile arrests in the city in the first 11 
months of 1987 more than twice the total of 883 for all of 1985 
on jan 26 two 14yearold youths were arrested at a motel with 
48000 worth of drugs police said 
a 12yearold boy was arrested in early january in southeast 
washington carrying a 9mm semiautomatic weapon 
barbara merriweather formed a group called citizens redirecting 
youth after her 17yearold son kendall was fatally shot on the 
way to school last december his killers wanted his boom box radio 
police said 
our children are being killed and theres a reason why mrs 
merriweather said i know that drugs play a part but society as 
a whole also plays a part we have to put some morals back into our 
children and back into society

in ottumwa iowa kathy pietraszewski stood in the doorway at 
the place where the republican caucus was held last monday night to 
encourage shy voters to cross the threshhold for pat robertson 
she was a oldier in robertsons invisible army 
there were two of mine that couldnt come because they were 
sick but there were four who surprised me says mrs 
pietraszewski 35 mother of two i knew them all as they came 
in i went out and personally met them so they wouldnt be afraid 
to go to the caucus 
when the heads were counted there were 64 and 43 of them gave 
the nod to robertson 
statewide robertson finished second behind bob dole but ahead 
of vice president george bush a shock to many but not to some 
robertson people who like mrs pietraszewski had been working for 
their candidate for months i told my family there will be lots 
of other christmases but this ones different 
the robertson ground troops new to politics and excited by 
success are starting to ask themselves if they have it within 
their power to put their man in office 
a lot of people have said well i agree with pat robertsons 
stands but i dont want to waste my vote the rev walter 
holder pastor of the first baptist church told the concord nh 
monitor that was before iowa my impression is now hes a little 
more electable there may indeed be a groundswell 
the rev john fortin of the faith christian center in bedford 
nh puts it this way if pat is gods man then somehow hes 
going to get in there but not without a lot of hard work and 
prayer 
and the rev ken borchers pastor of the united methodist church 
in ashland tells of a lunch that a group of clergymen had with 
robertson after getting to know him as a person borchers said 
we all laid our hands on him and prayed for him we prayed for 
strength and guidance and prayed if it is gods will that he be 
elected 
jeffrey k hadden a university of virginia sociologist and a 
robertson biographer says robertson came up with a masterstroke in 
insisting that three million followers sign petitions before he 
would decide to run the tactic gave robertson an army 
he asked people to pledge that theyd work for him pray for 
him and give him money says hadden political historians may 
view it as one of the most ingenious things a candidate ever did 
these days robertson soft pedals the churchbased foundation of 
his candidacy he says he should be thought of as a television 
network executive and the chancellor of a fully accredited graduate 
university to call him merely a tv evangelist he protests is 
bigotry and its an insult and it denigrates who i am and what i 
am and im sick of it 
for all that most of robertsons followers come out of the 
evangelical churches of america they know him best as a man of god 
and they speak of him often in language unblushingly tinged 
with theology 
i just believe robertson is going to win says gloria 
widmann of waterloo iowa he operates in miraculous wonders in 
terms of what the bible says prophecy healing miracles he 
operates just like jesus did and he loves just like jesus did and 
we need a man of god in the office 
in port huron mich billye knoik who quit her job as a church 
secretary to work for robertson scoffs at the term the press has 
given robertsons political flock 
these are just your common everyday folks from various and 
sundry backgrounds and pat is touching these people she says 
mrs knoik mother of three grown children got to know robertson 
from watching the 700 club on the christian broadcasting network 
in new hampshire where on tuesday robertson faces his first 
test in a primary mrs maria farris 37 of londonderry town 
chairman and robertsons local coordinator says the conventional 
wisdom that robertson will have trouble in a primary election 
has missed the point 
its there she says of a robertson postiowa surge 
theres a tremendous force that hasnt been really identified in 
the normal political process 
registration ended last weekend in new hampshire and city and 
town clerks say they were so busy for three weeks they didnt have 
time to leave their offices and grab lunch 
the lines were long nearly 1000 people registered in 
manchester on a saturday many are firsttime voters many 
registered undeclared meaning they can vote democrat or 
republican secretary of state william gardner estimates the late 
surge added 15000 to 25000 voters in a state where ronald reagan 
won the primary in 1980 with 73000 votes gardner cant guess how 
many of the new registrants are robertson supporters 
the rev keith marsh a pastor at the dartmouth area christian 
fellowship in new hamsphire says in 1986 about 50000 residents of 
the state gave money to the christian broadcasting network 
after iowa all the candidates flew to new hampshire but 
robertson went to minnesota which holds caucuses feb 23 and where 
a strong prolife movement has ties to fundamentalist churches 
doles minnesota cochairman carl ludeman says jack kemp is no 
longer doles greatest threat we feel that in minnesota we have 
only one competitor in grass roots organization thats pat 
robertson 
in hawaii where robertson won overwhelmingly in the feb 4 
republican caucuses gop chairman howard chong credits a 60 percent 
rise in party registration tp robertsons appeal 
says robertson cochairman gene ward we draw from mainstream 
conservatives evangelicals and those who know pat from the 700 
club 
in iowa retiree chuck underwood of des moines a lay pastor 
says robertsons appeal politicized the nonpolitical like 
himself 
ive got to get with it underwood tells a reporter ive 
got to get involved im ashamed to say thats the first caucus i 
ever attended 
were robertson people in iowa told to be evasive to pollsters so 
the robertson strength would come as a surprise 
no underwood says people have a little bit of a problem with 
the role of the media they were tightlipped on the thing 
guy rodgers of shenandoah iowa a robertson activist who has 
worked for a number of christian causes we had a lot of people 
support pat who we referred to as closet supporters i saw that in 
my own precinct i saw people we hadnt identified people we 
didnt know there were extra numbers here that we werent aware 
of 
the rev david nelms pastor a des moines baptist church says 
evangelical churches didnt outright support robertson but they 
sure gave up preaching that politics is securlar business to be 
shunned in favor of the lords work 
for years we heard christians should stay out of politics 
he says of late our leaders have encouraged the opposite

the stock market has reacted with 
uncharacteristic confusion to a drop in interest rates over the 
past several months 
a long decline in interest rates from their lofty levels at the 
start of the 1980s was widely cited as one of the primary forces 
behind the great bull market in stocks when rates surged upward 
last spring the stock market ran into trouble 
since the crash in october interest rates have come down again 
with yields on longterm treasury bonds falling from above 10 
percent to 84 percent as of friday but stock traders have shown 
little enthusiasm 
of course they have other worries on their minds black monday 
on oct 19 cast a long shadow 
beyond that however analysts say the latest drop in rates 
doesnt fit into the kind of textbook pattern that would lift 
investors spirits 
sustained declines in interest rates often occur in recessions 
prompted by weak demand for credit as rates fall they help set 
the stage for a rebound in business activity 
this time however they have moved lower against a backdrop of 
an economic expansion that is more than five years old and many 
observers see them as an early symptom of a business slump 
there has been very little corroborating evidence for that view 
in the statistical measures of the economy so far 
us exports set a record for the second straight month in 
december attesting to a revival in manufacturing if the latest 
data on retail sales are to be believed consumers havent run out 
of spending money 
over the last several weeks there has indeed been an 
accumulation of positive fundamentals said john connolly an 
analyst at dean witter reynolds inc they have moved the bond 
market rather than the stock market but that still counts 
it is quite normal for the bond market to react first and in 
a sense clear out a path for the stock market 
stocks did rally in the past week pushing the dow jones average 
of 30 industrials up 7278 points to 198326 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 351 to 14486 
the american stock exchange market value index 689 to 27700 and 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 752 to 
35327 
big board volume averaged 17943 million shares a day against 
19213 million the week before 
recession worries have been heightened by a run of three 
consecutive monthly declines in the governments index of leading 
economic indicators 
but maury harris economist at painewebber inc argues that the 
declines only portend a business slowdown instead of an outright 
recession 
in the past harris says threemonth declines in the leading 
indicators have foreshadowed recessions in cases where the federal 
reserve has been constrained from easing credit by other problems 
most notably inflation 
this time he maintains with inflation still subdued the trade 
deficit improving and the dollar having apparently stabilized 
the fed will respond to signs of weakness with an easier monetary 
policy 
just a couple of months ago the fed and its chairman alan 
greenspan appeared to be caught in a dilemma the central bank 
couldnt raise interest rates without hurting the economy and it 
couldnt lower them without risking a continuing slide of the 
dollars value in foreign exchange 
now says connolly the fed is in the most flexible position 
in a long time greenspan must feel relieved

fresh off the biggest yearly trade deficit in 
history us policymakers and economists are divided about how 
urgent it is to lower the gap in 1988 
the trade deficit is a favorite punching bag of presidential 
candidates but many economists say the reagan administration could 
make matters worse by trying to do away with it too rapidly 
the commerce department reported friday that the gap between 
imports and exports in 1987 totaled 1712 billion up from the 
previous record of 1562 billion in 1986 
a big drop in the dollar the surest method of closing the trade 
gap would trigger higher inflation by raising the cost of imports 
and straining the production capacity of us exporters 
the federal reserve would try to cool off high inflation by 
clamping down on credit which could very well send the economy 
into a severe recession 
recession would become a certainty if congress simultaneously 
slashed the federal budget deficit the other step demanded by 
presidential campaigners 
a sudden sharp decrease in the federal deficit whether by tax 
increases or spending cuts would undercut demand for goods and 
services that keeps the economy growing 
since the united states remains the major engine of world 
growth a recession here would mean recession abroad many 
economists say 
at the same time few doubt the wisdom of shrinking the federal 
budget deficit and the trade deficit in the long run 
the question then is how quickly the united states should be 
moving to cut its trade and budget deficits given the dangers of 
going too far too fast 
im rather sick and tired of people haranguing the united 
states for not getting its fiscal and trade deficits under 
control robert brusca chief fixedincome economist for nikko 
securities co international inc said in a speech this past week 
the budget deficit is rising but the trade deficit has turned 
decisively downward he and other economists note in december the 
merchandise trade gap was 122 billion the lowest since january 
1987 
brusca argues that the dollar has fallen far enough to make us 
goods competitive in world markets he predicted the dollar will 
rebound to 140 japanese yen by the middle of 1988 from about 131 
yen friday 
only slightly less optimistic fred peck of first boston corp 
predicts the dollar will reach the 140yen mark by the end of the 
year the united states he says is on a slow boat to 
regaining balance in trade 
at the other extreme are economists such as rudiger dornbusch of 
the massachusetts institute of technology who argues that the 
dollar needs to fall to 100 yen 
dornbusch advocates a cheaper dollar even though it makes the 
united states a poorer country harder for americans to afford 
imported products and easier for foreigners to scoop up us 
products and assets 
the dollar must fall he argues for a number of reasons latin 
america is too burdened with debt to buy us exports at current 
dollar levels asian nations have become more competitive 
foreigners have gained permanent beachheads in us markets and 
the united states for the first time since before world war i has 
to pay more to foreigners in investment income than it earns abroad 
dornbusch said he would like the dollar to fall gradually 
about 30 percent more in the next year or so but if it comes to a 
choice between a steep sudden fall and no fall he would prefer 
the steep one 
if it is locked in at its present rate we shall have to pay 
for a much larger and steeper plunge sometime later dornbusch 
said last fall in an article published by the federal reserve bank 
of atlanta 
to a great extent the argument over the dollars level will be 
decided by the worlds capitalists who decide whether the united 
states is a good place to stash money 
history shows the dollars value is only loosely tied to the 
nations trade performance the dollar began to soar in value in 
1982 at the very time the trade deficit was starting to worsen 
notes first bostons peck 
even though americans sent plenty of dollars overseas from 1982 
to 1985 to pay for their mounting trade deficits peck recalls 
foreigners were hungry for even more dollars because of attractive 
us interest rates and optimistic forecasts for us economic 
growth 
perhaps the optimists say that kind of confidence in the 
dollar is returning

the recent sharp downturn in interest rates has 
sent corporate america on a borrowing spree 
theres been no really big issues but a steady activity 
among all the highergrade to mediumgrade companies explained 
anthony naylor a corporate bond analyst for rodman amp renshaw inc 
people had been waiting some time to see something happen 
during the final week of 1987 only a couple of issues were put 
on the market totaling 15206 million according to securities 
data co inc which compiles financial information 
but by the following week the number of issues jumped to 30 
valued at 276 billion and in the last seven days of january they 
peaked at 76 totaling 556 billion securities data said 
activity slowed slightly this past week due to what traders 
described as a general malaise in the credit markets prior to the 
release of december trade figures on friday 
the sudden spurt in volume had been prompted largely by the 
rapid fall in interest rates and subsequent rise in bond prices 
which paralleled a growing spate of negative economic news 
traders in the credit markets believe that the federal reserve 
remains poised to keep rates low to avoid sending the economy into 
a recession rates had been on the rise until the oct 19 stock 
market crash in the treasury market alone the yield on the 
bellwether 30year bond had been nearing 10 perlcent before the 
crash and its now trading slightly above 8 percent 
its almost the same as you or i dealing with our finances 
when we see rates come down we decide at some point its 
attractive enough to take action said james j drury a 
corporate bond analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
a lot of corporate treasurers are thinking nows a good time 
to get into the market because the odds are that either rates wont 
go down much more or they might go up in the short term 
among the companies jumping into the market were general 
electric capital corp which issued 300 million in debt in early 
january quantum chemical which issued the same amount a week 
later and general motors acceptance corp which issued 200 
million in notes earlier this month 
analysts say most of the bond issues have been for capital 
spending or stock repurchases rather than for refunding of previous 
debt 
some have put the money from the issues in their corporate 
kitties for use down the road and what we call prefunding said 
drury 
meanwhile investors fortunate enough to have bought bonds prior 
to the recent rate decline have seen their securities rise in value 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer has risen about 6 percent since the start of the year 
jon cuscani who runs nikko securities co intl incs 
corporate bond trading notes that hydroquebecs 30year bond sold 
for around 991 per 1000 face amount and yielded 1081 percent 
when issued about the time of the crash lately each of those 
bonds has sold for around 1100 he said

cattle futures traders have developed the jitters on indications 
that the threemonth bull market may be coming to an end and a 
report due out on tuesday may seem to support that notion 
but a look at the big picture shows how deceptive the numbers 
can be an analyst says 
the agriculture departments monthly cattleonfeed report for 
the seven largest cattleproducing states is widely expected to 
show a modest reduction in both the number of cattle slaughtered 
and the number placed on feedlots in january compared with the same 
month a year ago 
taken at face value a reduction in those figures would seem 
positive for cattle prices because it apparently would indicate 
tightening supplies 
the problem is that supplies should not be declining at least 
not in the near term 
the number of cattle placed on feedlots for fattening back in 
august and september was higher than the placements figure a year 
earlier said chuck levitt an analyst in chicago for shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
those animals would normally have begun reaching acceptable 
slaughter weights in january which should logically be reflected 
by a higher january marketings figure in tuesdays usda report 
levitt said 
instead analysts who track the daily flow of cattle from 
feedlot to market expect the january marketings figure to be 
anywhere from 1 percent to 7 percent below the january 1987 figure 
thats creating some nervousness within the industry that 
maybe theyre falling behind in marketings which would mean a 
larger carryover of cattle from january to february of this year 
levitt said 
an increasing backlog of cattle destined for slaughter would 
have a negative influence on prices especially in these days of 
consumer concern over the fat and cholesterol content of red meat 
beef products already face stiff competition from poultry and fish 
which are lower in cholesterol and an increase in beef supplies 
would likely drive prices lower 
those fears surfaced on the chicago mercantile exchange this 
past week in three straight days of declining cattle futures prices 
after two days of fairly sharp gains 
but levitt said the monday and tuesday advances tell the real 
story of the markets eventual direction 
the sharp surge on monday and followthrough buying on tuesday 
were reactions to the usdas semiannual cattle inventory report 
which was released the previous friday 
that report showed the nations cattle herd had shrunk for the 
sixth consecutive year and that the number of calves under 500 
pounds those that could be fattened for slaughter later this year 
was down 10 percent from a year earlier 
feedlots are jammed now as producers attempt to take advantage 
of current high prices but the decline in calf numbers eventually 
will become the dominant factor in the market levitt predicted 
the number of cattle out there that are not yet on feedlots 
is getting smaller and smaller he said 
were supporting larger feeder inventories now but thats not 
going to last forever levitt said halfway through this year 
our onfeed number will be lower than a year ago and thats why 
were so bullish

record exports helped push the nations trade deficit down to 
122 billion in december but 1987 still went down as having the 
highest shortfall ever the government reported 
the deficit for the full year totaled 1712 billion the 
commerce department said friday 
on wall street the stock market had a subdued response to the 
report the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 2172 to 
198326 bond prices fell as concern grew about inflation but the 
dollar soared against most major currencies 
decembers merchandise trade deficit was down from 132 billion 
in november and from 176 billion in october and was the smallest 
figure since a 119 billion trade gap in january 1987 the 
commerce department said 
the improvement was driven by a 42 percent rise in exports 
which reached record levels for the second month in a row 
both private and government analysts pointed toward the december 
report as strong evidence of the longawaited reversal in the 
nations trade peformance 
exports in december were 248 billion a new record up from 
238 billion in november the previous record imports meanwhile 
held steady at 370 billion the same as the month before 
for all of 1987 americans imported 4241 billion in goods 
while exporting 2529 billion compared with 1986 imports of 
3830 billion and exports of 2268 billion 
analysts credited the slide in the dollar now worth half of 
its 1985 value against the japanese yen and key european currencies 
as being the major factor in the recent export surge 
a devalued dollar makes american goods cheaper abroad 
in other economic data on friday 
the labor department said its producer price index rose 04 
percent in january equivalent to an annual rate of inflation of 
46 percent with higher costs for a variety of items including 
food offsetting lower energy prices 
the commerce department said business inventories shot up 08 
percent in december the third consecutive large monthly advance 
pushing unsold stockpiles on shelves and backlots up by 545 
billion to a seasonally adjusted 70187 billion

earlier this week appeared to be on the downward path in its 
yearlong range between 1575 and 1775 
another factor pressuring crude prices was an overnight decline 
in north sea brent crude on the london exchange said jayne ball a 
broker at dean witter reynolds inc
